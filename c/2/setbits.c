/*
  Exercise 2-6. Write a function setbits(x,p,n,y)
   that returns x with the n bits that begin at position 
   p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged.


   let's create a simple example using chars:

   the char value of 200 (x) would be 

   11001000

   the car value of 20 (y) would be

   00010100 

   let's say p is 1 and n is 2

   return x with the 2 bits at position 1 

  So position 2 bits from position 1 (using lsb) would be 00


  add that to right most bits of y
