[[Two people are talking, one in a hat.]]
Hatless: it's just so hard to compare kids now with kids in the past. you can't help but to belong to one group or the other.

Hatless: and of course every generation seems awful to the one before it. look at quotes from throughout history.

Hatted: yeah, and it sure would be nice to have some perspective on some of this stuff. I just don't know what to make of it.
[[Circles are appearing--maybe snow?]]

Hatless: i guess you do what you can to help the people around you and hope it turns out okay.

Hatless: in the end, what else can you do?

Hatted: lead a crusade?

[[We can no longer see the people, just the circles.]]
it's presentism, man. the idea that historical context is irrelevant, that we understand it all

that we need take no warnings from the follies of the past. that we're facing something new.

socrates couldn't imagine the internet. but people don't change.
[[We can start to see the corner of a darker circle in the lower right.]]

((The borders between the three panels on this line are cracking.))

have you seen those collections of historical pornography? talk about historical context.

did you know the first porn photo was bestial in [[inside a circle:]] nature?

at least that stuff was out of the mainstream [[each word in one circle:]] no just in history

((the three panels have merged into one on each row.))

Man 1: Your sociopathic abuse of random strangers staggers me.
Man 2: I aspire to have more creativity than the common asshole.

76		Familiar		[[A man and a woman are talking]]
Woman: I worry that I'm just with you because it's familiar. Of course no one else compares. I've known you for so long that I'd have to spend years with someone to build up this kind of connection 
and I daren't let you go of you long enough to let that happen.
Woman: But I guess this is really all I can ask for.
I'm happy with you; I should stop worrying.

Girl: I, you... wow.  Geekiness aside, that was actually incredibly sweet.
Man: The clutter of everyday life, with a simple core to tie it together, eventually becomes something grand as the world itself.
[[A rainbow extends outward from the TV, with "ROYAL RAINBOW!" above it.]]

[[Men and women are standing in a row]]
Man: English should be the national language. These immigrants should have to learn English when they come here.
Woman: Yeah
Man: When you go to live somewhere, you learn the language they speak there. English is the language of the land.

{{Alt: The only downside is that it would be a little uncomfortable}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/escher_wristband.jpg
89		Gravitational Mass		Hat Guy: Gravitational mass is identical to inertial mass. That is, the amount of inertia something has and the amount of gravity it has are effectively the same. What's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be any reason this should be true. One could imagine an extremely large object with lots of resistance to force and no gravity (or vice versa), but this is never observed.
Hat Guy: You know what? I'm just gonna skip the rest of the buildup and say it: Yo mama's fat.

Guy's thoughts: I love the time just before sunrise. It's quiet; no one is ever just walking about. It's like a secret. I always hope that I'll find someone else quietly hiding from sleep, and we'll see each other and sit and talk. I guess this is a bad place to meet people. I wish it weren't.

Person: I doubt it.
Phone: What about a baby's first word?
Person: Look, your obsession with sending strange things through the mail is getting out of hand.
Phone: Can you mail a blank stare?

Person: . . .

103		Moral Relativity		[[A graph, rationalization as a function of speed, increasing exponentially with an asymptote at c]]
Related to moral relativism, it states that ethics become subjective only when you approach the speed of light.  That is, it's okay to be self-serving, steal, and murder as long as you're going really, really fast.

Then one day it happened. You were torn from my arms and vanished from this world.

106		Wright Brothers		[[A man and a woman are talking to each other]]
Man: I've heard that when the Wright brothers argued, they periodically switched sides in the debate to try to encourage a more balanced conclusion.
Man: We should try that in our relationship!
Woman: It's a neat idea, but I think treating personal issues like a debate will only engender hostility and hurt feelings.
Man: No, I think it would help, by forcing us to consider the other person's point of view.
Woman: Hmm, maybe you're right.
Man: Am not.  It's a bad idea.

Hat Guy: A laughable claim, Mister Bond, perpetuated by overzealous teachers of science. Simply construct Newton's laws into a rotating system and you will see a centrifugal force term appear as plain as day.
Mr. Bond: Come now, do you really expect me to do coordinate substitution in my head while strapped to a centrifuge?
Hat Guy: No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.

[[Excerpt from the exam paper.]]
Name: _________
[[A stick figure is standing, hands over head. A velociraptor is running towards it.]]
1. The velociraptor spots you 40 meters away and attacks, accelerateing at 4 m
s^2 to its top speed of 25 m
s. When it spots you, you begin to flee, quickly reaching yourtop speed of 6 m
s. How far can you get before you're caught and devoured?
2. You're at the center of a 20m equilateral triangle with a raptor at each corner. The top raptor has a wounded leg and is limited to a top speed of 10 m
s.
[[A stick figure is shown in the above situation. The picture has a legend "(Not to scale)".]]
The raptors will run toward you. At what angle should you run to maximize the time you stay alive?
3. Raptors can open doors, but they are slowed by them. Using the floor plan on the next page, plot a route through the building, assuming raptors take 5 minutes to open the first door and halve the time for each subsequent door. Remember, raptors run at 10 m
s and they do not know fear.

A: You should be more careful what you write. Future employers might read it.
B: When did we forget our dreams?
A: What?
[[B stands beside A]]]
B: The infinite possibilities each day holds should stagger the mind. The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox. We live trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out before us. We see the same things every day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us.
B: And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of some day easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up.
B: This is very important, so I want to say it as clearly as I can:
B: FUCK.
B: THAT.
B: SHIT.

I can just see him, reading my uncultured swill masquerading as his florid prose.

Narrator: But he's not angry, no. He's sitting at his desk smiling that condescending half-smile, the corner of his mouth belying the self-assurance of a writer who never misplaces a word. His firm hands rest easily on the keyboard, his right thumb caressing the space bar gently, as I enter the room. He knows I'm there without turning around, and I'm too nervous to speak. But I don't have to; he understands, I can see it in the way his eyes play over me, reading my fears and doubts in a glance and washing them away with a knowing smile. Then he's on his feet, he's in front of me, and I don't feel the electric jolt I expected as our hands meet. It's just warm, warm and right: As I sink into his eyes I feel a hand on my shoulder, and I see Tycho smile at someone behind me. Gabe is standing there, grinning that mischievous grin, and twirling his beloved cardboard tube between his fingers.
Narrator: The night has just begun.

162		Angular Momentum		[[Man sits on his bed, looking at a girl who is spinning.  It is night.]]
Man on bed: What are you doing? 
Girl: Spinning counterclockwise
Each turn robs the planet of angular momentum
Slowing its spin by the tiniest bit
Lengthening the night, pushing back the dawn
Giving me a little more time here

163		Donald Knuth		[[Two programmers, one with a black hat and one without a hat, are sitting back to back at two separate desks, typing.]]
No-Hat Programmer: Man, you're being inconsistent with your array indices.  Some are from one, some are from zero.
Black-Hat Programmer: Different tasks call for different conventions.  To quote Stanford algorithm's expert Donald Knuth, "Who are you?  How did you get in my house?"
No-Hat Programmer: Wait, what?
Black-Hat Programmer: Well, that's what he said when I asked him about it.

164		Playing Devil's Advocate to Win		Man: Yes, from the evidence it looks pretty likely to me that we're causing global warming on a horrific scale.  But with science you don't need to argue.  It doesn't matter who wins the debate -- it's about reality.  By just waiting a little longer, we'll get to SEE who was right.  It feels unethical but I find myself wanting to keep quiet about the science just to know for sure.  As terrible as it sounds, the state of the world isn't really my responsibility.  I'm just thrilled to get to watch.  If the scientists are right -- and if we keep people from understanding just a little longer -- we'll enjoy quite a ride.  And pragmatically, on the outside chance that they're all wrong, I get saved the embarrassment of having spoken up.
{{alt: There are so many well-meaning conservatives around here who just assume global warming is only presented as a moral issue for political reasons.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/global_warming.png

Person in Car: What the hell?
Person in Street: Usually they're at least a little off. But I've been watching like 30 seconds and haven't seen any beat frequency!
Person in Car: Who are you?
Person in Street: You know, from the beat frequency you can tell the difference in timing of the two signals.

Random Guy: There are three words in the English language that end in "gry". "Angry" and "Hungry" are two. What's the third?
Hat Guy: I don't think there is one, unless you cound really obscure words.
Random Guy: Ha! It's "language"! I said there are three words in "the English--"

Man: Every morning for a week now I've gone out driving before sunrise.
I wanted to get lost in the dark, park my car, listen to music, and sip from a warm drink as dawn broke around me, gradually revealing a landscape I'd never before seen.  A chain of unique beinnings forcing wonder into the seeds of each day.
But I guess I need more willpower, because each sunrise just found me at your mom's apartment again.

177		Alice and Bob		[[Girl with black hair stands in the frame, talking to the reader]]
Girl: I'm sure you've heard all about this sordid affair in those gossipy cryptographic protocol specs with those busybodies Schneier and Rivest, always taking Alice's side, always labeling me the attacker.
Girl: Yes, it's true.  I broke Bob's private key and extracted the text of her messages.  But does anyone realize how much it hurt?
Girl: He said it was nothing, but everything from the public-key authenticated signatures on the files to the lipstick heart smeared on the disk screamed "Alice."
Girl: I didn't want to believe.  Of course on some level I realized it was a known-plaintext attack.  But I couldn't admit it until I saw it for myself.
[[Girl places her hands on her hips]]
Girl: So before you so quickly label me a third party to the communication, just remember: I loved him first.  We had something and she tore it away.  She's the attacker, not me. - Not eve.

First Man: Hey, Dr. Nash, I think those gals over there are eyeing us.  This is like your Nash Equilibrium, right?  One of them is hot, but we should each flirt with one of her less-desirable friends.  Otherwise we risk coming on too strong to the hot one and just driving the group off.
Second Man (Dr. Nash): Well, that's not really the sort of situation I wrote about.  Once we're with the ugly ones, there's no incentive for one of us not to try to switch to the hot one.  It's not a stable equilibrium.
First Man: Crap, forget it.  Looks like all three are leaving with one guy.

Please, stop, because seeing this happen to you breaks my heart.
[[Figure B:]]
Conspiracy theories represent a known glitch in human reasoning.  The theories are of course occasionally true, but their truth is completely uncorrelated with the believer's certainty.  For some reason, sometimes when people think they've uncovered a lie, they raise confirmation bias to an art form.  They cut context away from facts and arguments and assemble them into reassuring litanies.  And over and over I've argued helplessly with smart people consumed by theories they were sure were irrefutable, theories that in the end proved complete fictions.

The Electromagnetic Spectrum

These waves travel through the electromagnetic field. They were formerly carried by the aether, which was decommissioned in 1897 due to budget cuts.

Other waves:
- Slinky waves [[Two people hold the ends of a tangled slinky.]]
- Sound waves [[There is a snippet of a frequency band. Between 20 Hz and 20 KHz is labeled "Audible Sound." Towards the top is a line labeled "That high-pitched noise in empty rooms."]]
- The wave [[A row of people does a wave.]]

[[Three parallel scales are across the bottom. The first is lambda (m), ranging from 100Mm to 100fm; second is f (Hz), which starts at 1 Hz and reaches 100 THz about 2
3 of the way along, after which the labels read "other entertaining greek prefixes like peta- exa- and zappa-"; last is Q (Gal^2
Coloumb), whose labels are 17, 117, pi, 17, 42, theta, e^pi-pi, -2, 540^50, and 11^2. Above the scales and lined up accurately with the first two are the following:]]

- Power & Telephone (100Mm to 1km)
- Radio & TV (1km to somewhere between 1m and 10cm); above that are many boxes showing subranges (AM, VHF, UHF, 14
7 NPR pledge drives, a very thin band for the space rays controlling Steve Ballmer, 99.3 "The Fox," 101.5 "The Badger," 106.3 "The Frightened Squirrel," cell phone cancer rays, CIA, ham radio, kosher radio, shouting car dealership commercials)
- Microwaves (a bit more than 10cm to a bit more than 1mm); it also has subranges (aliens, just below SETI, wifi, FHF, brain waves, sulawesi, gravity)
- Toasters (about 1mm to about 100 micrometers)
- IR (about 100 micrometers to somewhere between 1 micrometer and 1 nm); above that is a bell graph labeled "Superman's heat vision," with a motorcycle driving up the left side labeled "Jack Black's Heat Vision."
- Visible light (and, under it, visible dark); above that is a bell graph labeled "sunlight." There's a breakout chart above it showing the visible spectrum from 700nm (red) to 450nm (violet). There's an arrow pointing to where octarine would be, somewhere off to the side. Above that are bars showing the absorption spectra for hyrogen, helium, Depends(R) (yellow only) and Tampax(R) (red only).
- UV (about 100nm to about 10nm)
- Miller Light (a thin bar around 10nm)
- An unlabeled section with a thin line above it showing the frequency of the main death star laser
- A blocked-off portion labeled "Censored Under Patriot Act."
- X-rays (from about 1nm to about 10pm); a line above shows the frequency of mail-order x-ray glasses. Somewhere vaguely above the 10pm mark is a potato.
- Gamma
cosmic rays (10pm and smaller); above that is a bar marked Sinister Google Projects which also trails off into higher frequencies, and blogorays, which are slightly lower.

[[Epilogue]]
Elaine shared her ideas with Bram Cohen, who went on to develop BitTorrent.
Mrs. Roberts spends her time developing for Ubuntu, and defacing the websites of people who make "your mom" jokes to her daughter. Elaine still stalks the net. She joins communities, contributes code or comments, and moves on. And if, late at night, you point a streaming audio player at the right IP at the right time - you can hear her rock out.

406		Venting		[[Above frame]]  When I need to blow off steam, I find a particularly stupid blog comment and reply with an exhaustively researched word-by-word rebuttal, which I sign "Summer Glau".
[[Guy sitting at computer typing away]] ... In conclusion, on examining the above post by CrackMonkey74, after carefully working my way through the haze of spelling errors (documented in section 3), abuse of capitalization (section 4), and general crimes against grammar and syntax (sections 7-8), I have demonstrated that, beneath it all, the work betrays the author's staggering ignorance of the history and the workings of our electoral system.  While the author's wildly swerving train of thought did at one point flirt with coherence, this brief encounter was more likely a chance event (see statistical analysis in table 5) than a result of even rudimentary lucidity.

657		Movie Narrative Charts		These charts show movie character interactions. The horizontal axis is time. The vertical grouping of the lines indicates which characters are together at a given time.

[[Lord of the Rings. A mass of colored lines weaves back and forth across the chart, representing various characters. Sauron is represented by a huge black bar at the bottom with branches for nazgul, orcs, etc. Major locations (Moria) and plot points (the breaking of the fellowship) are marked. Gandalf, especially at the beginning, jumps all over the map in a short time. Eagles appear and then disappear a couple of times. Treebeard's line is flat except for the march to Isengard. At the end, the ship to the West drifts off into a corner.]]

[[Star Wars (original trilogy). This chart is simpler. Luke, mostly accompanied by R2-D2, joins and parts from other sets of characters. There's a dotted alternative path on Jabba's line for the special edition. Yoda appears about halfway through (where Luke's Jedi training is marked). All the surviving lines group up at Endor except for Vader, the Emperor, Luke, and Lando; after the climactic duel, the latter two join the rest.]]

[[Jurassic Park. The human characters are in black; dinosaurs are in red. Dilophosaurus appears briefly to eat Nedry and then fades out again. The three raptors are together at the beginning, but split up about halfway through. One has a dotted portion of line between "locked up" and "escapes." In the meantime, they cut off the lines of Arnold and Muldoon. The raptor lines all end when t-rex's swoops down to meet them at the end, and all the surviving humans leave together.]]

[[12 Angry Men. The lines are labeled Juror 1 through Juror 12. They are all perfectly horizontal and parallel.]]

[[Primer. Three lines start on the left labeled Abe, Aaron, and Granger. They enter a mass of scribbling. Somewhere vaguely towards the end, three lines emerge and fade out, all labeled with question marks.]]

681		Gravity Wells		((A schematic of the depths of the gravity wells of each planet in the solar system and several moons. At extreme left, an arrow pointing down and to the left, labeled "To Sun, very very far down". From left to right the gravity wells depicted are: Mercury; Venus; Earth, 5,478 km; Moon, 288 km; Mars, 1,286 km; Ganymede; Io; Jupiter; Europa; Titan, with two small bumps captioned "WEEOOOEEOOOEEEOOO"; Saturn, with its rings depicted as various-colored horizontal bands; Uranus; and Neptune, with a figure exclaiming, "An even more glorious dawn awaits!"

Inset below Earth, the Moon, and Mars are three panels depicting Mars', Deimos's, and Phobos's gravity wells. The Mars inset shows Mars' gravity well, 1,286 km deep, in relation to its moons, Deimos and Phobos, and a NASA Mars Exploration Rover. The Deimos inset shows Deimos' gravity well and a person, labeled "to scale"; the gravity well is approximately two thirds the height of the person, and the caption reads, "You could escape Deimos with a bike and a ramp." The Phobos inset is similar, except that the gravity well is approximately three times the height of the person included for scale, and reads, "A thrown baseball could escape Phobos."

To the right of Jupiter's gravity well is a diagram of a well. The height of the well is labeled "very deep"; at the bottom is a figure labeled "your mom"; and three figures, labeled "local football team", are shown falling in head first. Beneath that, the text reads, "Jupiter is not much larger than Saturn, but much more massive. At its size, adding more mass just makes it denser due to the extra squeezing of gravity. If you dropped a few dozen more Jupiters into it, the pressure would ignite fusion and make it a star."

At the right of the panel is an inset diagram detailing Earth's gravity well, which is labeled as being 6,379 km deep. Also depicted are the altitudes of low Earth orbit, the ISS, the Space Shuttle, GPS satellites, geosynchronous orbit, and the Moon's gravity well, 288 km deep. A figure standing on the Earth's "surface" says, "This is why it took a huge rocket to get to the moon, but only a small one to get back." Beneath that, the text, "It takes the same amount of energy to launch something on an escape trajectory away from Earth as it would to launch it 6,000 km upward under constant 9.81 m
s² Earth gravity. Hence, Earth's well is 6,000 km deep."
))
Gravity wells, scaled to Earth surface gravity

This chart shows the 'depth' of various solar system gravity wells.

Each well is scaled such that rising out of a physical well of that depth -- in constant Earth surface gravity -- would take the same energy as escaping from that planet's gravity in reality.

Each planet is shown cut in half at the bottom of its well, with the depth of the well measured down to the planet's _flat_ surface.

The planet sizes are to the same scale as the wells. Interplanetary distances are not to scale.

Depth = (G x PlanetMass) 
 (g x PlanetRadius)

G = Newton's constant
g = 9.81 meters per second squared

with charts and graphs of my feelings for you
[[A graph shows romance and happiness. Romance cuts off, indicating a breakup before the meeting of the narrator and his current SO, and happiness dips accordingly.

and the happiness you've brought me.

But the more I analyzed
[[The narrator works at a computer]]
r_0 =  0.20
r_1 = -0.61
r_2 = -0.83
the harder it became to defend my hypothesis.

In science, you can't publish results you know are wrong
and you can't withhold them because they're not the ones you wanted.

So I was left with a question: do I make graphs because they're cute and funny,
[[The narrator sits, looking at a sheet of paper.]]
or am I a *scientist*?

Enclosed are my results.
I hope you can find somebody else
[[A jagged, declining graph is superimposed over a red heart.]]

[[The two men converse.]]
First Man: It's only my mental rules that stop me from punching you, or stripping naked, or getting on a plane to Fiji. Sure, rules have reasons. But shouldn't you exercise that freedom at least once before you did?

The upper terminal leads to a line that is going to the upper terminal of that cloverleaf and to a battery symbol (with the + and - symbols on the wrong ends) with a value of â2V.  The right terminal of the cloverleaf is going into a resistor symbol label "120Î© or to taste".  Connected to the other terminals of the resistor and battery is a switch that is labeled "glue open".  The bottom of the two lines has a transistor with two emitters, one P and one N, and no collector.  The P-type emitter is connected to the top line and a jar of scarab beetles.  Above the beetles is a resistor labeled "brown blue orange". To the right is an unlabeled resistor with a center tap going into a capacitor, with a ground on the other end.  Above the capacitor is a diode, and below an inductor.  To the right is another inductor.  The two inductors and ground are all covered by a "solder blob".  The rightmost component is a "666 timer" that has pin 5 going into a question mark.

Back to the left side, below and to the left of the cloverleaf is a compass rose.  The bottom terminal of the cloverleaf is connected to a battery, labeled 50V, with grounds on both sides.  To the right of the battery is a long horizontal wire that is labeled "pull this wire really tight."  That wire is hooked up to a vertical wire that connects to the N-type emitter of the transistor above it.  To the right is an AC source that is labeled 240V, shorted out, with a label on the short "omit this if you're a wimp."  To the right of that is an inductor that is labeled with "11kg", a batman symbol, and a squirrel.

Back to the left end of the diagram, where the blender is, there is a wire that is labeled as a distance 3
8" from the wire with the 50V battery.  To the right there is a frowny face, then a vertical wire with a 90 degree bend labeled "caution â±".  That leads into a balloon.  Under the balloon is an inductor symbol with a line on the bottom edge labeled as "warm front".

Underneath the blender and to the right of the Arduino is a resistor labeled "ë".  To the right is an electric eel, a capacitor, an unlabeled resistor, and a gob of hot glue attached to a chip with an inverter hooked to an XOR gate, both with feedback into each other.  Under the electric eel is a neck strap.  To the right of the XOR gate and inverter is a bridge rectifier labeled as "Moral rectifier"  to the right again is a bottle of magic smoke, under that a fishing bobber and then a broken wire labeled with a question mark. 

Under the most expensive chip available there is a vertical wire labeled with "electrons single file".  To the right is a switch labeled "hire someone to open and close switch real fast."  To the right of that is a contact labeled "touche tongue here".  Below that is a resistor labeled "5Î© (decoy)" with only one terminal connected.  To the right of the contact is a methyl group attchaed to a wire.  To the right of the methyl group is a complex mesh of 1Î© resistors labeled with "oh, so you think you're such a whiz at EE201?"

Connected to the wire labeled "electrons single file" is a wire bent in a U shape with an upside-down ground on the end.  To the right is a flux capacitor with the bottom wire labeled I-95.  To the right of that is a wire labeled yarn, then an arena with two diodes going in and one leaving.  The right diode has a ground on its anode labeled "bury deep, but not too deep."  To the right of that is a motor labeled vibrator, resistor with a value of Ï, and a 500V AC source.

Under the flux capacitor is a wire that leads out of frame with a label "â to center of sun".  To the right is a 55 MPH speed limit sign, then an SR latch (flip-flop) labeled "may use an actual sandal instead".  Connected to the Q of the SR latch is a holding pen and to the inverting Q output is a wire in a knot, a resistor labeled "8mm", a resistor symbol labeled "not a resistor; wire just does this", and a motor symbol labeled "to scale".

Under the wire that leads off to the center of the sun is a tangled mess of wires connected and jumping over each other, then a photo diode labeled "tear collector".  Under the tear collector is a wire in the shape of a ECG.  To the right is a light bulb, a capacitor-looking symbol labeled 3 liters, a resistor labeled yes, an unlabeled inductor, a resistor with a question mark as a label.  To the right of all that is an inductor labeled "take off shirt while wiring this part.  Ooh, yeah, I like that."  Finally, in the lower right hand corner is a ground symbol immersed in a beaker of holy water.]]		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/circuit_diagram.png

beautiful

802		Online Communities 2		[[A giant, untranscribable map of the internet. Apologies from the transcriber, who did her best to include as much as she could without going nuts.]]

((Label in the center of main map.))
Updated Map of Online Communities
Size on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the 
Spring and Summer of 2010

[[Two insets on the upper left-hand corner shows that this map is a tiny portion of the huge continent of Spoken Language, encompassing portions of the Internet, Email, and Cell Phones (SMS).]]

[[The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is "Facebook" -- with large states in the southeast of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.

A peninsula on the southwest, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the southeast of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the southwest part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.

The Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.

In the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmvile and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.

To the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.

East of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)

To the southwest if Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]]

[[An inset of a group of islands in the sea of memes located on the lower right corner of the map, labeled 'Forums'. The largest by far is 4chan and 
b
. Also found here are D2JSP, JLA Frums, Fan Forum, Something Awful, and many smaller ones, too numerous to list here.]]

[[The northeastern third of Gossip
Political
Tech Blogs island is another inset labeled 'Blogosphere (Core)'. This can be found on the lower left corner of the map. Two peninsulas in Political Blogs bookend the Bay of Flame -- these are Liberal Blogs and Conservative Blogs. Between them lie several tiny islands such as Politics Daily, CNN Politcal Ticker, and Mediaite. Off the coast of Liberal Blogs lies the island of NYTimes, off the coast of Conservative Blogs is Libertarian Isle. Between the two lies The Talk. The northern peninsula of Tech Blogs contains places such as Gizmodo, Engadget, Joystiq, and Kotaku.]] 

((Text found between the two insets, which are directly below the main map.))
ABOUT THIS MAP
Communities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some paring of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.

Estimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leafing reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).

Sources of data include Google and Bing, Wiipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.

803		Airfoil		Handling a student who challenges your expertise with an insightful question:
[[There's a picture of the cross section of an airfoil, with an arrow above and below, pointing from right to left.  Layered on top of these arrows, pointing up and down at the cross section, are a larger arrow below and a smaller arrow above.]]
((This panel just contains text, and has a speech curlique hanging towards the person in the next panel.))
Teacher: So, kids, the air above the wing travels a longer distance, so it has to go faster to keep up.  Faster air exerts less pressure, so the wing is lifted upward.

Student: But then why can planes fly upside down?

((The teacher is standing, pondering the question.  Three arrows point out of this panel, leading to each of the next three panels which are arranged vertically.))

((This is a label at the top of the panel, not a character speaking.))
Right: 
((This is the character speaking.))
Teacher: Wow, good question!  Maybe this picture is simplified -- or wrong!  We should learn more.

Wrong:
Teacher: It's... complicated.
Teacher: And we need to move on.

Very wrong:
Teacher: Santa Claus is your parents.

{{Title text: This is a fun explanation to prepare your kids for; it's common and totally wrong. Good lines include 'why does the air have to travel on both sides at the same time?' and 'I saw the Wright brothers plane and those wings were curved the same on the top and bottom!'}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/airfoil.png
804		Pumpkin Carving		[[Beret guy stands next to a pumpkin with a picture of a pumpkin carved into it]]

Interlocutor: Taking on teen vandals, I see.
HatGuy: Heavens, No. My pumpkin simply has chest pains. In fact, I'll leave a note 
warning
 them not to smash it.
[[Long-haired stick figure stands next to a jack-o'lantern]]
HairFigure: My pumpkin's name is Harold. He just realized that all the time he used to spend daydreaming, he now spends worrying. He'll try to distract himself later with holiday traditions, but it won't work.
[[Generic stick figure stands next to two pumpkins and a knife]]
StickFigure: I carved and carved, and the next thing I knew I had 
two
 pumpkins.
Interlocutor: I 
told

Person: ... restart my computer? I know you have a script to follow, but the uplink light on the modem is going off every few hours. The problem is between your office and the modem.

Person: My computer has nothing to do with ... okay, whatever, I "restarted my computer."
Person: It's still down, and even if it comes back, it's going to die again in a few hours, because your--

Person: I don't HAVE a start menu. This is a Haiku install, but that's not import--
Person: Haiku? It's an experimental OS that I ... oh, never mind.

Person: I'm sorry, but this won't get fixed until I talk to an engineer. Can you look around for someone wearing cargo pants, maybe a subway map on their wall?

[[The tech support person on the other end is wearing a headset, and looks around.]]
Tech: There's a chick two phones over with a stuffed penguin doll and a poster of some bearded dudes with swords.
Person: Perfect. Can you put her on?
Tech: Sure.

[[Person is now talking to the engineer.]]
Person: Hey, so sorry to bother you, but my connection--
Engineer: Yeah, I see it. Lingering problems from a server move.
<<type type>>
Engineer: Should be fixed now.
Person: Thank you SO MUCH.

Engineer: No problem. Hey, in the future, if you're on any tech support call, you can say the code word "shibboleet" at any point and you'll be automatically transferred to someone who knows a minimum of two programming languages.

Person: Seriously?
Engineer: Yup. It's a backdoor put in by the geeks who built these phone support systems back in the 1990's.
Engineer: Don't tell anyone.

Person: Oh my god, this is the greatest--
[[Person wakes up.]]
Person: Wha--

807		Connected		[[A girl sits on a rock and a boy sits on the grass]]
Girl: Seriously? I like that song too! I bet no two people in the history of the world have ever been so connected!
Caption: I'm not sure why we romanticize "young love".

{{Title text: Or love in general, for that matter. It just leads to the idea that either your love is pure, perfect, and eternal, and you are storybook-compatible in every way with no problems, or you're LYING when you say 'I love you'.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/connected.png
808		The Economic Argument		{{A table is labeled with three columns: "Crazy phenomenon," "If it worked, people would be using it to make a killing in..." and "Are they?"}}

Astrology, Tarot - Financial
Business Planning -
Crystal Energy - Regular Energy -
Curses, Hexes - The Military -
Relativity - GPS Devices - X
Quantum Electrodynamics - Semiconductor Circuit Design - X

Eventually, arguing that these things work means arguing that modern capitalism isn't THAT ruthlessly profit-focused.

Los Alamos, 1945...

Left figure: Wow. Um. Question: Just to double-check - although I'm 99% sure -

Left figure: Is it "Soh cah toa" or "coh sah toa"?

Middle figure: Oh, for the love of... can someone redo Steve's work?

Right figure: I don't want to do the test anymore.

{{Title text: The test didn't (spoiler alert) destroy the world, but the fact that they were even doing those calculations makes theirs the coolest jobs ever.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/los_alamos.png

[[Beret guy think for a moment, then runs away, comes back with a mirror, and holds it up towards the stars]]

{{Title text: Don't worry! From the light's point of view, home and your eye are in the same place, and the journey takes no time at all! Relativity saves the day again.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/starlight.png
812		Glass		[[Woman is singing, man is staring at a flass of water on a table.]]
Woman: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... Anything break?
Man: No, but the water in the glass turned to wine.
[[Man picks up glass]]
Woman: Weird.
Man: No, wait. This is blood.
Woman: Okay, Physics, quit fucking with us.
Physics: You stop looking for the higgs boson and we'll talk.

A graph of productivity vs Coefficient of friction of desk chair shows a curve that drops off very quickly as the coefficient of friction approaches zero, with the productivity becoming negative at low values. It plateaus in the middle of the graph, and then begins to drop less steeply as coefficient of friction increases above the optimal point.]]

Woman #1: Wow. I can't find fault with your proof.

[[The woman is still looking at the white board, the frame expands to show a second woman walking away, rubbing her hands together in an evil manner.]]
Woman #1: You've show the inconsistency -- and thus the invalidity -- of basic logic itself.
Woman #2: Excellent, on to step two.

Dear Dr. Knuth,

Guy's thought bubble: Every day you take this route to class, she's sitting on that bench, reading.

[[It goes even closer to her face.]]

847		Stingray Nebula		[[Two white figures are silhouetted against a dark sky.  They're sitting on top of a grassy hill.]]
Person: I know things are tough right now.  When I was going through some difficult times as a kid, I would go up on the roof and look through my telescope.

Person: One day I found a tiny star in Ara that seemed friendly.
Person: There were millions like it, but I decided that this one was mine.

Person: When things got bad, I'd go find that star, and think of my favorite Tolkien quote.  It's from Sam's time in Mordor.

((The next panel is diagonally downward to the right of the previous.  The upper left corner overlaps.))
[[A star is above the highest peak in a chain of mountains.]]
"There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while.  The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him.  For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing: There was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach."
- The Return of the King

Companion: That's comforting!
Person: It was rather undercut in 1987, when the light from my star's explosion reached Earth.  The debris forms the Stingray Nebula.

Companion: There's probably a lesson there.
Person: "Never trust an unstable asymptotic giant branch star.  Stick with main sequences and dwarfs."
Companion: I'll, uh, keep that in mind.

Scientist (to guy): We'd been seeing this brain damage for years, but only recently did our linguists identify the pattern behind it.

Scientist: The patients fixate on animals and types of people whose names are trochees (two syllables, with the accent on the first).

The malfunction causes a rush of dopamine whenever these trocheese are heard or spoken.
[[Chart shows "internet" and "brain," with arrows marked "trochees" traveling both ways between them. An arrow marked "dopamine" loops from the brain back to the brain.]]

 modem.

[[A close-up of the man, looking down at the tower at his feet.]]

931		Lanes		((The panels are arranged top to bottom.  The first is set above a larger image.))
Person: So, are you guys out of the woods?
Second Person: We don't know.
Person: Well, did the treatment work?
Second Person: We don't know.

[[The diagram shows a simple highway.  Starting at the bottom, with diagnosis for five lanes, the road travels through a cloud of treatment, after which two lanes disappear, and three continue.  Later on, there's another offramp labeled 'cancer "comes back"', which loops back into the treatment cloud.  Otherwise, the highway enters a later cloud called survive.]]
I always assumed that when you got cancer, they gave you a prognosis, then treated you, and at the end of treatment either you beat it or you died.
And I knew sometimes it "recurred," which I assumed meant back to square one.
But that's turned out not to be quite right.

[[Back to the two people.]]
Second Person: Once most cancers spread out into your body, they're incurable.
Second Person: If your 10-year prognosis is 60%, that means a 40% chance that some cancer will slip past the treatment and get out.

Second Person: So they kill all the cancer they can find, and then you're a "survivor."  But your odds are still 60%.

[[The frame zooms just to show the second person.]]
Second Person: They can't scan for individual cancer cells.  The only way to know if it worked is to wait for tumors to pop up elsewhere.
Second Person: If you go enough years without that happening then you were in the 60%.

[[The frame shows both people again.]]
Second Person: And often the first sign is a cough or bone pain.
Second Person: So you spend the next five or ten years trying not to worry that every ache and pain is the answer to the question "Do I make it?"

((There's an extra large panel, with a small one floating inside it.))
[[The panel shows roughly fifty lanes emerging from the cloud of 'Treatment'.  Signs show 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years.  Lanes branch off and fade into darkness earlier on the right, with some lanes continuing off the top of the panel.]]

((Inset panel.))
Person: Man.

933		Tattoo		[[There is one human in the panel.  The human points at their chest.]]
Human: I just have one tattoo - it's six dots on my chest, done by my oncologist.

Human: I need them for aligning the laser sights on a flesh-searing relativistic particle cannon,

Human: So it will only kill the parts of me

[[Dramatic zoom, the panel background is black, with white text.]]
Human: That are holding me back.

[[The panel is larger, revealing who they're talking to.]]
Human: But your barbed wire bicep tattoo is pretty hardcore, too!
Dejected: No, it's OK.  I'll just go put a shirt on.

935		Missed Connections		((The page is set up like the missed connections area of Craigslist, with a list of messages from an individual to a person they weren't able to communicate with at the time.))
Personals > Missed Connections

You: Clinging to hood of your stolen wienermobile, trying to reach into engine to unstick throttle

936		Password Strength		((The comic illustrates the relative strength of passwords assuming basic knowledge of the system used to generate them. A set of boxes is used to indicate how many bits of entropy a section of the password provides. The comic is laid out with 6 panels arranged in a 3x2 grid. On each row, the first panel explains the breakdown of a password, the second panel shows how long it would take for a computer to guess, and the third panel provides an example scene showing someone trying to remember the password.))

[[The password "Tr0ub4dor&3" is shown in the centre of the panel. A line from each annotation indicates the word section the comment applies to.]]
Uncommon (non-gibberish) base word [[Highlighting the base word - 16 bits of entropy.]]
Caps? [[Highlighting the first letter - 1 bit of entropy.]]
Common Substitutions [[Highlighting the letters 'a' (substituted by '4') and both 'o's (the first of which is substituted by '0') - 3 bits of entropy.]]
Punctuation [[Highlighting the symbol appended to the word - 4 bits of entropy.]]
Numeral [[Highlighting the number appended to the word - 3 bits of entropy.]]
Order unknown [[Highlighting the appended characters - 1 bit of entropy.]]
(You can add a few more bits to account for the fact that this is only one of a few common formats.)

~28 bits of entropy
2^28 = 3 days at 1000 guesses
sec
(Plausible attack on a weak remote web service. Yes, cracking a stolen hash is faster, but it's not what the average user should worry about.)
Difficulty to guess: Easy.

[[A person stands scratching their head trying to remember the password.]]
Person: Was it trombone? No, Troubador. And one of the Os was a zero?
Person: And there was some symbol...
Difficulty to remember: Hard.

[[The passphrase "correct horse battery staple" is shown in the centre of the panel.]]
Four random common words {{Each word has 11 bits of entropy.}}

~44 bits of entropy.
2^44 = 550 years at 1000 guesses
sec
Difficulty to guess: Hard.

[[A person is thinking, in their thought bubble a horse is standing to one side talking to an off-screen observer. An arrow points to a staple attached to the side of a battery.]]
Horse: That's a battery staple.
Observer: Correct!
Difficulty to remember: You've already memorized it

((The caption below the comic reads: Through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember, but easy for computers to guess.))

937		TornadoGuard		((The comic is a single panel which resembles a reviews page for a mobile phone application))

Application name: Tornado Guard

938		T-Cells		[[Two people are standing facing each other, having a conversation. One is holding a laptop.]]
Person #1 (with laptop): What's the deal with this leukemia trial? {{Citation: Nejm, Aug 10, 2011}}
Person #2: Gotta wait and see.
Person #2: Helping the immune system attack tumors has been a longtime research target.
Person #2: Lots of promising leads. Often they don't pan out.

Person #1: What'd these guys do?
Person #2: They took some of the patient's T-cells and patched their genes so they'd attack the cancer. That hasn't been enough in the past but their patch also added code to get the T-cells to replicate wildly and persist in the body.

Person #1: Which worked, but created its own set of problems?
Person #2: How'd you guess? But I think the craziest part is the way they insert the patched genes.
Person #1: How?
Person #2: Well, think - What specializes in invading and modifying T-cells?
Person #1: Seriously?
Person #2: Yup. Must've been a fun conversation.

[[The last panel is set in a doctors office. A patient is sitting on the observation bed talking to their doctor.]]
Patient: Ok, so I have blood cells growing out of control, so you're going to give me different blood cells that *also* grow out of control?
Doctor: Yes, but it's ok, because we've treated *this* blood with HIV!
Patient: Are you sure you're a doctor?
Doctor: Almost definitely.

{{Title text: 'We're not sure how to wipe out the chimeral T-cells after they've destroyed the cancer. Though I do have this vial of smallpox ...'}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/t_cells.png
939		Arrow		[[An archer stands with a bow and arrow drawn tightly, aiming off-screen.]]

[[They fire the arrow, it disappears offscreen. The bowstring vibrates for effect.]]

[[They stand holding the bow by their side, watching the arrow fly away.]]

[[A boomerang flies on-screen, coming from the direction the arrow was fired. The archer reaches up to catch the boomerang.]]

[[The couple is standing in front of the computer; one person is at the keyboard, the other standing back wearing a towel.]]
At Keyboard: Come on! That was like two hours of cardio!
In Towel: Hmm, let's see ... the part on the dresser was KIND of like skiiing ...

{{Title text: I felt so clever when I found a way to game the Fitocracy system by incorporating a set of easy but high-scoring activities into my regular schedule. Took me a bit to realize I'd been tricked into setting up a daily exercise routine.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/oversight.png
941		Depth Perception		((The comic is narrated by an unspecified person. All dialog is shown in boxes overlaid on the comic panels.))

[[The panel background looks like a cloudy sky, with the clouds all running together and appearing as a blue
grey smear.]]
I've always had trouble with the size of clouds.
I 
know
 they're huge. I can see their shapes.
But I don't really see them as objects on the same scale as trees and buildings.
They're a backdrop.

[[A person stands on a flat disk inside a hemispherical dome with the front half cut away. The dome is labelled "Sky", and the disk is labelled "Ground". The dome is about twice as tall as the person.]]
Stars are the same way.

I know they're scattered through and endless ocean, but my gut insists they're a painting on a domed ceiling.

((The next two lines of dialog are stretched over the following three panels.))
[[A person stands on a curved surface, looking up.]]
If I try hard enough, I get a glimmer of depth, a dizzying sense of space,

[[The perspective of the scene shifts, suddenly the surface the person was standing on is in the top left of the panel. The person is now looking down, leaning back, and waving their arms trying to regain balance.]]
But then everything snaps back.

[[The perspective of the scene returns to normal, the person is now semi-crouched, staring at the ground with legs spaced apart to help them balance.]]

[[An american football field is shown, with sections at the tips of the goal posts highlighted and shown as a zoomed view in an insert box. The goal posts each have a webcam mounted on top of them.]]
So one summer afternoon
I set up two HD webcams hundreds of feet apart,
Pointed them at the sky,

((The next two lines of dialog are stretched over two panels each.))
[[The first panel shows a pair of glasses with the note "Very strong reading glasses." and a smartphone with an attachment designed to clip onto the glasses. The smartphone screen is setup to display two images side by side such that one camera is visible in the left half of the screen, and the other camera is visible in the right half of the screen.]]
And fed one stream to each of my eyes.

[[The next panel shows the completed phone
glasses assembly.]]
The parallax expanded my depth perception by a thousand times,

[[The person stands wearing the phone
glasses assembly, staring into the sky.]]
And I stood in my living room
At the bottom of an abyss

[[The person now stands on the shore of an unidentified coastline (possibly Boston?), a city is near their right foot and the tallest skyscraper appears ankle high. A mountain range is behind them that is also barely ankle high. The person is standing with their head well above cloud level as clouds swim around them.]]
Watching mountains drift by.

{{Title text: I've looked at clouds from both sides now.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/depth_perception.png
942		Juggling		[[The panel shows a close up of a person reading a book. The book is called "How To Juggle" and has a picture of a person juggling on the cover.]]

[[The view now shows the entirety of the person. A book is splayed on the floor behind them, and they are holding some juggling balls.]]

[[The person throws the juggling balls in the air.]]

[[They lower their arms to prepare to catch the balls. The balls are still hovering in mid-air.]]

[[The person now stands with their arms by their sides. The balls have not moved and are still suspended in mid-air.]]

[[The person jumps, trying to grab the lowest ball. They can't reach.]]

[[The person scratches their head and stares at the still floating juggling balls.]]

[[They throw the book into a trash can.]]

{{Title text: Later: 'Why is there a book hovering over the trash can?'}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/juggling.png
943		Empirical		[[Two people are standing together, one with long hair (presumably female) and one without visible hair (presumably male).]]
Woman: Will you marry me?

[[The male person throws his hands in the air excitedly.]]
Man: Let's find out!

[[The couple are now standing in front of an altar. A flower arch stretches over the couple and a person is standing behind the altar. The female person is wearing a knee length white dress and a veil. The male person is wearing a bow tie. They are holding hands.]]

[[The couple stand together, still dressed from the wedding and still holding hands.]]
Man: Apparently, yes!

{{Title text: I'm as surprised as you!}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/empirical.png
944		Hurricane Names		[[A weather reporter sits behind a desk with an image of the Gulf of Mexico and surrounding land masses displayed to his left. 9 hurricane symbols are scattered across the map, primarily over Cuba.]]
Reporter: After the latest wave of hurricanes, not only have we run through the years lit of 21 names, but we've also used up the backup list of Greek letters. All subsequent storms will be named using random dictionary words.
Reporter: The newly-formed system in the gulf has been designated "Hurricane Eggbeater", and we once again pray this is the final storm of this horrible, horrible season.

{{Title text: After exhausting the OED, we started numbering them.

945		I'm Sorry		[[Two people are standing next to each other having a conversation.]]
Person 1: My Mom's house burned down.
Person 2: Oh! I'm sorry!
Person 1: Why? It's not 
your
 fault.
Person 2: It's nice of you to say that, but I know what I did.

It annoys me when people interpret an obviously sympathetic "I'm sorry" as an apology, so I've started responding by making it one.

{{Title text: You know I've always hated her.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/im_sorry.png
946		Family Decals		[[Two cars are parked next to each other. The car on the left is an urban SUV and has stickers on the rear window representing a family. From left to right there is an adult male, adult female, female youth, male youth, and young child. The car on the right is a sporty hatch back, it has similar stickers on the rear window, with an adult male and adult female. Instead of the youth and child stickers there is instead a large pile of money.]]

{{Title text: My decal set has no adults, just a sea of hundreds of the little girl figures closing in around a single cat.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/family_decals.png
947		Investing		Person 1: Sure, 2% interest may not *seem* like a lot. But it's *compound*!

[[Person 2 opens a computer and begins calculating]]
Person 1: If you invest $1,000 now, in just ten short years you'll have.. ..let's see..

Person 1: ..$1,279.

Person 1: Ok, so compound interest isn't some magical force.
Person 2: Yeah, I'm just gonna try to make more money.

{{Title text: But Einstein said it was the most powerful force in the universe, and I take all my investment advice from flippant remarks by theoretical physicists making small talk at parties.}}

948		AI		[[A person with shoulder length hair sits on a wheeled computer chair at a desk. A laptop computer is on the desk playing some sort of media with audio. The person is facing away from the computer addressing someone off panel.]]
Person: Did you see the Cleverbot-Cleverbot chat?
Computer: I am not a robot. I'm a unicorn.

[[The first person has wheeled away from the desk and is now seating in front of the second person.]]
Person 2: Yeah. It's hilarious, but it's just clumsily sampling a huge database of lines people have typed. Chatterbots still have a long way to go.

[[The panel shows a close-up of the first persons head and shoulders. They have a hand to their chin and appear to be contemplating the last remark.]]
Person 1: So... Computers have mastered playing chess and driving cars across the desert, but can't hold five minutes of normal conversation?
Person 2 (off-screen): Pretty much.

[[The panel shows a wide view of both people again.]]
Person 1: Is it just me, or have we created a Burning Man attendee?

{{Title text: And they both react poorly to showers.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ai.png
949		File Transfer		[[A person stands near a computer, talking on the phone to another person.]]

Person 1: You want your cousin to send you a file? easy. He can email it to- ... Oh, it's 25 MB? Hmm...
Person 1: Do either of you have an FTP server? No, right.
Person 1: If you had web hosting, you could upload it...
Person 1: Hm. We could try one of those MegaShareUpload stes, but they're flaky and full of delays and porn popups.
Person 1: How about AIM Direct Connect? Anyone still use that?
Person 1: Oh, wait, Dropbox! It's tis recent startup from a few years back that syncs folders between computers. You just need to make an account, install the-
Person 1: Oh, he just drove over to your house with a USB drive?
Person 1: Uh, cool, that works too.
I like how we've had the internet for decades, yet "sending files" is something early adopters are still figuring out how to do.

Amelia: Hey everyone! My flight was a success!
Off-screen person: But... Where were you?

[[The frame shows a wide view of Amelia again, she stops waving.]]
Amelia: I flew around the world!
Off-screen person: But you disappeared in 1937!

Amelia: Right, to fly around the world.
Off-screen person: It's 2011!
Amelia: The world is big. It's a long flight.

Off-Screen person: But you...

951		Working		[[A person is standing next to a petrol bowser filling their vehicle with petrol. They are being addressed by a different person, who is pointing off-screen.]]
Person 2 (talking to 1): Why are you going here? Gas is ten cents a gallon cheaper at the station five minutes that way.
Person 1 (pumping gas): Because a penny saved is a penny earned

((The caption below the panel reads: "If you spend nine minutes of your time to save a dollar, you're working for less than minimum wage."))

Person: This is a long escalator.
Hat man: 70 meters. Longest in the country.

[[The view opens a bit wider. In the background the girl from the last panel has now passed the group and a few other people can be seen descending.]]

Person: Why're you carrying a chin-up bar?
Hat man: Why aren't you wearing a hat?

[[The view opens up to show the same people in the first panel. They're near the top of the escalator now and the girl with the ponytail is beginning to step off.]]
Person: Seriously, why did you bring it?
Hat man: How should I know? I'm not a psychologist.

One person has grabbed another by the hair and is standing on a third person in an attempt to not fall. Someone is falling off the pile and another person is running down the escalator to avoid them. People closer to the bottom of the escalator are looking horrified at the scene ahead of them. In the background hat man and his companion are visible. Hat man is looking toward the bottom of the escalator, not caring or noticing the chaos unfolding. His companion looks back pensively.]]

Man: No, this isn't 
about
 whether relativity exists. If it didn't, your GPS wouldn't work. -- What do you mean, "science thought police"? Have you seen our budget? We couldn't 
begin
 to afford our own thought police.

Person 1: What if the place sucks?
Black Hat Man: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.

Person 1: You punish companies you like!
Black Hat Man: The odds of *my* review putting a hotel out of business are negligible.
Person 1: If we all did that the system would collapse!
Black Hat Man: Doesn't affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.

The baseball is forming the centre of the 'e' while the arm provides the break for the tail.

Toward the right of the image the space between the 'E' and 'x' has been decorated to look like a Guy Fawkes mask, with ties wrapping around the 'x' and being drawn off-screen.

977		Map Projections		((The comic is one large panel, with different types of map projections listed in two columns. Each listing has an illustration of that projection plus a short paragraph describing the individual who prefers that projection.))

What your favourite Map Projection says about you.

Mercator
[[A drawing of the Mercator projection is shown. In this the world is distorted to fit into a perfect square, centred on Africa.]]
You're not really into maps.

Robinson
[[A drawing of the Robinson projection is shown. Areas near the poles in this projection are fairly distorted, but the distortion is greatly reduced when moving toward the equator.]]
You have a comfortable pair of running shoes that you wear everywhere. You like coffee and enjoy the Beatles. You think the Robinson is the best-looking projection, hands down.

Winkel-Tripel
[[The Winkel-Tripel projection is similar to the Robinson projection, with less distortion at the poles. However the distortion at equivalent latitudes differs as the longitude varies.]]
National Geographic adopted the Winkel-Tripel in 1998, but you've been a W-T fan since 
long
 before "Nat Geo" showed up. You're worried it's getting played out, and are thinking of switching to the Kavrayskiy. You once left a party in disgust when a guest showed up wearing shoes with toes. Your favourite musical genre is "post-".

Hobo-Dyer
[[The Hobo-Dyer projection is a cylindrical projection resulting in significant latitudinal distortion. The result is a rectangular image with the poles vertically compressed, and land near the equator stretched.]]
You want to avoid cultural imperialism but you've heard bad things about Gall-Peters. You're conflict-averse and buy organic.l You use a recently-invented set of gender-neutral pronouns and think that what the world needs is a revolution in consciousness.

A globe!
[[It's a globe.]]
Yes, you're very clever.

Pierce Quincuncial
[[This is a square projection centred over the north pole. The continents stretch out radially from the centre of the map and bits of Antarctica are visible in each corner of the projection.]]
You think that when we look at a map, what we really see is ourselves. After you first saw 
Inception
, you sat silent in the theater for six hours. It freaks you out to realise that everyone around you has a skeleton inside them. You 
have
 really looked at your hands.

((The second column of projections starts here.))

Van Der Grinten
[[This projection displays the continents inside a perfectly circular frame. The continents are displayed with similar distortion to what you would see in the Robinson or Winkel-Tripel projections.]]
You're not a complicated person. You love the Mercator projection; you just wish it weren't so square. The earth's not a square, it's a circle. You like circles. Today is gonna be a good day!

Dymaxion
[[The Dymaxion projection attempts to unfold the earth into a polyhedral net, centred on the north pole. The map has no set shape, instead it looks to be made out of a series of triangles.]]
You like Isaac Asimov, XML, and shoes with toes. You think the segway got a bad rap. You own 3D goggles, which you use to view rotating models of better 3D goggles. You type in Dvorak.

Goode Homolosine
[[The Goode Homolosine projection attempts to minimise distortion by combining two equal area projections onto a split projection. The map resembles a smooth unfolded net, with landmasses kept whole where possible.]]
They say mapping the earth on a 2D surface is like flattening an orange peel, which seems easy enough to you. You like easy solutions. You think we wouldn't have so many problems if we'd just elect 
normal
 people to congress instead of politicians. You think airlines should just buy food from the restaurants near the gates and serve 
that
 on board. You change your car's oil, but secretly wonder if you really 
need
 to.

Plate Carrée
(Equirectangular)
[[This projection maps latitude and longitude to a rectangular grid, leading to significant longitudinal distortion near the poles.]]
You think this one is fine. You like how 
x
 and 
y
 map to latitude and longitude. The other projections overcomplicate things. You want me to stop asking about maps so you can enjoy dinner.

Waterman Butterfly
[[This projection unfolds the world into a net, similar to the Dymaxion projection. It is centred on the Atlantic, and resembles a butterfly with the Americas on the western wing, with Europe and Africa on the eastern wing.]]
Really? You know the Waterman? Have you seen the 1909 Cahill map it's based-- ...You have a framed reproduction at home?! Whoa. ...Listen, forget these questions. Are you doing anything tonight?

Gall-Peters
[[Another rectangular projection, this map suffers significant distortion near the poles, and significant latitudinal distortion in general.]]
I 
hate
 you.

{{Title text: What's that? You think I don't like the Peters map because I'm uncomfortable with having my cultural assumptions challenged?  Are you sure you're not ... ::puts on sunglasses:: ... projecting?}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/map_projections.png
978		Citogenesis		Where Citations Come From:

Citogenesis Step #1
Through a convoluted process, a user's brain generates facts. These are typed into Wikipedia.
[[A guy with short hair sits at a desk, typing on a laptop.]]
Guy: (typing) The "scroll lock" key was designed by future Energy Secretary Steven Chu in a college project.

A rushed writer checks Wikipedia for a summary of their subject.
[[A woman with a ponytail sits at a desk, typing on a desktop.]]
Woman: (typing) US Energy Secretary Steven Chu, (Nobel Prizewinner and creator of the ubiquitous "scroll lock" key) testified before Congress today...
Step #2

Surprised readers check Wikipedia, see the claim, and flag it for review. A passing editor finds the piece and adds it as a citation. 
[[A man sits on a couch with a laptop in his lap, typing.]]
Man: Google is your friend, people. (typing) <ref>{{cite web|url=
Step #3

Step #4
Now that other writers have a real source, they repeat the fact.
[[A flow chart, with "Wikipedia citation" in the center. The word "Wikipedia" is in black, the word "citations" is white with a red background. 
A black arrow leads from "brain" to "Wikipedia."
A black arrow labeled "words" leads from "Wikipedia" to "careless writers," and a red arrow labeled "citations" leads back to "Wikipedia citations." 
A black & red arrow leads from "Wikipedia" to "cited facts" which leads to "slightly more careful writers," which leads to "more citations," which leads back to "Wikipedia" (all black & red arrows).]]
References proliferate, completing the citogenesis process.

993		Brand Identity		[[The incredibly varied shelf of a supermarket aisle.  There are many different types of products on this shelf.  Each type has numerous different brands, all surrounding a very plain brand that has, as its only label, the type of product.  A plain bag, labeled in plain black letters, says "Potato Chips" and is surrounded by all the other various brands of potato chips.  The same exists for tissues, crackers, matches, peanuts, hot sauce, sugar , milk, pasta, coffee, black beans, lima beans, mayo, ketchup, tea, and bread.  There is a stark contrast between the incredibly noisy and complex labeling of every other brand and this simple one.]]

1010		Etymology-Man		Person 1: Earthquake!
Person 2: We should get to a higher ground - There could be a tidal wave.

[[Person 1 takes a pedantic pose]]
Person 1: You mean a tsunami. "Tidal wave" means a wave caused by tides.

[[A crash is heard, followed by Etymology-Man flying in while wearing a cape]]
Etymology-man: You know, that doesn't add up.
Person 1 and Person 2: Etymology-man!

[[Etymology-man takes a pedantic pose]]
Etymology-man: What *does* "tidal wave" mean? There are waves caused by tides, but they're "tidal bores", and they're not cataclysmic. It can refer to the daily tide cycle, but that's obviously not what people mean when they say "a tidal wave hit". It's been obvious for centuries that these waves come from quakes. So why "tidal"?

Etymology-man: Remember that until 2004, there weren't any clear photos or videos of tsunamis. Some modern writers even described them rearing up and breaking like surfing waves. Of course, in 2004 and 2011, it was made clear to everyone that a tsunami is more like a rapid, turbulent, inrushing tide - exactly what historical accounts describe.

[[Water begins to rush in.  Etymology-man keeps his pedantic pose]]
Etymology-man: Maybe those writing about Lisbon in 1755 used "tidal wave" not out of scientific confusion, but because it described the wave's form - a description lost in our rush to expunge "tidal wave" from English.

[[The water is now waist-deep.  Etymology-man continues to drone on, but the others start to panic]]
Etymology-man: "Tsunami" is now the standard, and I'm not trying to change that. But let's be a tad less giddy about correcting "tidal wave" - especially when "tsunami" just means "harbor wave", which is hardly...

And so do the "C" and the "E" in "OFFICES", to the point that it actually looks like TWO words.  And the I and the C are so close together, they almost look like a freakish K!

1017		Backward in Time		When I have a boring task to get through -- a three-hour lecture, a giant file download, or a long term point goal in fitocracy -- I use this formula to convert the percentage completed (p) into a date:

T=(Current Date) - (e^(20.344p^3) - e^3) years

When the task is 0% done, it gives today's date, and as I make progress, I move further and further back in time

((inverse given in lighter colors))
Inverse: p = sqrt((ln(T+e^3)-3)
(20.3444))

[[Line Graph explaining the correlation between completion percentages and temporal deltas.
0% = now ((Date of comic is 2012-02-14T00:00-0500, approx. 1329195600 UNIX))
10% = September 2011
20% = 2008
30% = 1997
40% = 1958
50% = 1776
60% = 405 AD
70% = 22,000 years ago
80% = 671,000 years ago
90% = 55 million years ago
100% = 13.8 billion years ago
]]

It moves slowly through the first few years, then steadily accelerates. I tuned the formula so the time spent in each part of the past is loosely proportional to how well I know it. This means I hit familiar landmarks with each bit of progress, giving me a satisfying sense of movement.

((The following are panels detailing completion percentages, correlated time periods, and notable events from this time period))

7.308% December 18, 2011
Around this time:

Pickup Artist.: I've been learning tricks from pickup artist forums.
Normal Guy: Pickup artists are dehumanizing creeps who see relationships as adversarial and women as sex toys

[[The camera angle changes to show another pair of people in the background.  One is a woman; the other is Black Hat Man.]]
Pickup Artist: No, it's just a bunch of tips! Like "Negging": You belittle chicks to undermine their self-confidence so they'll be more vulnerable and seek your approval.

Normal Guy: Just talk to them like a fucking human being.
Pickup Artist: Nah, that's a sucker's game. Ok - wish me luck!

Meanwhile...
[[Focus changes to the table with the second pair. Black Hat Man gets from his chair and carries a bowling ball with him.]]

Normal Guy: Oh no.

[[Pickup Artist takes a smarmy stance at Woman]]
Pickup Artist: You look like you're on a diet. That's great! How's the fruit plate?

Woman: Ooh - are we negging? Let me try!

Woman: You look like you're going to spend your life having one epiphany after another, always thinking you've finally figured out what's holding you back, and how you can finally be productive and creative and turn your life around.  But nothing will ever change. That cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. It's who you *are*.  The thing standing in the way of your dreams is that the person having them is *you*.

[[Pickup artist looks rightfully dejected]]
Woman: Ok, your turn! Ooh, try insulting my hair!
Pickup Artist: I think I need to go home and think about my life.

So far so good...

[[A third line goes up and to the left, creating a 58-degree angle with the last line. The drawing now sort of resembles a tent being blown over in the wind.]]
Steady as she goes...

[[The fourth line goes down and to the right, creating an approximately 47-degree angle with the last line, and our star is beginning to look a bit askew.]]
...uh oh.

"Ever cleaned a leopard? They're *filthy*"
"The iPhone virtual leopard is the fastest IMO"
"I rarely email from my phone - I'm so slow when I'm not on a leopard"
"My leopard died when I spilled tea on it :("]]

1043		Ablogalypse		[[A line graph with four lines, each representing 'Google Trends Search Volume' of different search terms over time from prior to 2005 to just after 2012. A blue line represents "blog," which trends gradually but significantly upwards from well before 2005 until it reaches a peak between 2008-2009, and starts to very slowly descend to today. A red line represents "Tumblr", which is at zero until it slowly starts to trend upward in early 2010, and then sharply increases in late 2010 and through 2011 and 2012. As of the date of this comic, 'blog' still beats 'Tumblr' in terms of search volume, but a dotted line projection of the trend shows that on October 12, 2012, the two lines will cross.  A yellow line represents 'Wordpress,' which has very low volume until a very small and gradual increase in 2007, which gradually increases to this day but doesn't come close to meeting the volume of either 'blog' or 'Tumblr'. A green line represents 'LiveJournal,' which started out prior to 2005 at around the level 'Wordpress' is at now, but declined through 2005 and 2006 until it has plateaued until virtually nothing.]]

1. "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."
2. "Returning Medicar to solid footing represents our greatest entitlement challenge."

8. "Hey, the room is getting smaller."
9. "It would be impossible to reach runanimity on every aspect of our budget."
10. "Grandpa, look over there across the river! They're little men!"
11. "I'm... going too high! Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down! Help! Grandpa, the fan!"

1052		Every Major's Terrible		Every Major's Terrible
To the Tune of Gilbert & Sullivan's
Modern Major-General Song

(Which you may know from Tom Lehrer's 
Elements
.
If not, just hum 
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
.)

[[Each panel shows a member of a different major.  First up is a philosopher.]]
Philosophy's just math sans rigor, sense, and practicality

And math's just physics unconstrained by precepts of reality.

A business major's just a thing you get so you can graduate

And chemistry's for stamp collectors high on methylacetate.

Why anyone who wants a job would study lit's a mystery

Unless their only other choice were something like art history.

A BA in communications guarantees that you'll achieve

A little less than if you'd learned to underwater basket-weave

I'd rather eat a Fowler's Toad than major in biology,
<<Ribbit>>

And social psych is worse than either psych 
or
 sociology.

[[At this point the singer is shown talking to a balding professor at a desk.]]
The thought of picking any one of these is too unbearable.

Just put me down as "Undecided" -- Every major's terrible.

[[Back to pictures of majors.]]
Now, if you can't prognosticate, that's ok in seismology,

But if your hindsight's weak as well, you'd best stick to theology.

CS will make each day a quest to find a missing close-paren.

Virology will guarantee you'll never get a hug again.

I.T. prepares you for a life of fighting with PCs nonstop.

As Pratchett said, 
Terry Pratchett: "Geography's just physics slowed with trees on top."

Though physics seems to promise you a Richard Feynman-like career,

The Wiki page for "Physics Major" redirects to 
"Engineer."


They say to study history or find yourself repeating it,

But all that it prepares you for is forty years of teaching it.

[[And back to the explanation at the desk.]]
I recognize my four-year plan's at this point not repairable,

But put me down as "Undecided" -- every major's terrible.

[[More pictures of majors.  The astronomer appears to be the Bad Astronomer]]
Astronomers all cringe when they hear "supermoon" or "zodiac,"

Agronomy's a no-go; I'm a huge agorophobiac.

I'm too ophiophobic to consider herpetology,

And I can't stomach any part of gastroenterology.

While pre-med gives you twitchy-eyed obsession with your GPA,

((This panel is done in free verse))
   a
 poetry degree
    bespeaks
bewildering
      naiveté.

TV's behind the rush into forensic criminology

(or so claims meta-academic epidemiology).

By dubbing econ "Dismal Science" adherents exaggerate;

The "dismal"'s fine -- it's "science" where they patently prevaricate.

[[And back to the desk a final time.]]

In terms of choices, I'd say only Sophie's was comparable.

1064		Front Door		[[A graph titled 'Walking Back to My Frong Door at Night': the x axis represents geographic location, where 0 to around the midpoint is 'yard', a point beyond the midpoint is 'steps', a point after that is 'door', and all points afterward are 'inside.' 
A blue line, labeled 'Fear That There's Something Behind Me' begins to slowly increase from the start, with a slight dip further into the yard, and a steep increase right before the steps, maxing on the steps, and decling steeply at the door, bottoming out once inside.
A gray line, labeled 'Forward Speed' is at a steady medium height until it gets to the steps, at which point it shoots upwards, and then slowly declines once inside. 
A red line, labeled 'Embarrassment' stays at 0 until just before the steps, where it begins to trend upwards, spikes at the door, and begins to slowly decline once inside.

[[Panel labeled "Second Week". The path has been modified so that it does not go through "Folding Area" - only through the other 4 ovals.]]

[[Panel labeled "Third Week". The path has been modified so that it does not go through "Dresser & Closet". Only "On Body", "Hamper", and "Washer & Dryer" remain.]]

[[Panel labeled "Second Month". The path no longer passes through "Hamper" - only "On Body" and "Washer & Dryer".]]

[[Panel labeled "End of Semester". The path no longer goes to "Washer & Dryer", instead just looping back around from "On Body" to "On Body" again after passing through the "Floor".]]

Person 1: Have you tried SwiftKey?  It's got the first decent language model I've seen. It learns from your SMS
Email archives what words you use together most often.

Person 1: Spacebar inserts its best guess. So if I type "The Empi" and hit space three times, it types "The Empire Strikes Back".
Person 2: What if you mash space in a blank message?

Person 1: I guess it fills in your most likely first word, then the word that usually follows it..
Person 2: So it builds up your "typical" sentence. Cool! Let's see yours!

This [[indicating a small section of 8 planets out of the several hundreds]] is our solar system.  
The rest of these orbit other stars and were only discovered recently.  
Most of them are huge because those are the kind we learned to detect first, but now we're finding that small ones are actually more common.  
We know nothing about what's on any of them. With better telescopes, that could change.

They just kept having sex, night after night, [[bed containing Phil and Rita repeats]] February 2nd after February 2nd... [[calendar page repeats]] ..forever

But nothing is forever. Not even forever

And the day *after* that sexual infinity [[calendar page here]] was February 3rd.

1080		Visual Field		Your Central Visual Field

((This comic contains numerous visual elements arranged around a central point, and are intended to represent locations in a sphere with the eyeball as the center.  Underlaid below all of the elements are concentric circles representing degrees from straight ahead, using the eyeball's point of view, denoting where these elements would appear in someone's field of vision given proper setup.  For this description, elements will be described using this grid plus location in degrees within the specified circle, placing 0 degrees to the right and going counterclockwise, separated with the word "mark".))

[[At the top are the instructions to view this page]]
Look at the center with your eyes this far from the screen.
[[A rolled-up sheet of paper that equals about 55 total horizontal degrees in width in the measurement of the chart]]
(You can roll up a sheet of paper and cut it - or zoom the page - so it matches this image)

17 mark 0: right eye blind spot. 

from 0 to 30 mark 15: [[The same image, increasing in absolute size from a very tiny object in the center to one about 20x original size at 30 degrees]]
Detail - We only see at high resolution over a small area in the center of our vision where retinal cells are densest (the fovea).  If you stare at the center of this chart, your eyes are seeing all these panels at roughly the same level of detail.

9 mark 105: Moon.

7 mark 112: Supermoon. 

from 0 to 20 mark 170: [[Sets 3 partially overlapping circles in multiple locations along this path. Each set has a primary color in each circle and additive colors in the overlap areas, with color saturation decreasing sharply as the sets leave the center.]] 
Color Vision: We don't see much color outside the center of our vision - our brains keep track of what color things are and fill it in for us.

17 mark 180: Left Eye Blind Spot. (not pictured: T-Boz blind spot, Chilli blind spot)

from 0 to infinity mark from 180 to 205: [[A swath of blue, with heavier saturation up to 5 degrees from center to fading, but never gone out to the edges of the image]]
from 0 to 7 from 205 to 235:[[A swath of red, with full saturation in the center and fading out completely at 7 degrees from center]]
from 0 to 7 from 235 to 270:[[A swath of green, with full saturation in the center and fading out completely at 7 degrees from center]]
Red and green-sensitive cones are mainly limited to the center of our vision.  We have few blue-sensitive cone cells, but they're found out to the edge of our vision.

25 mark 205: [[A small whisp of white in a swath of blue]]
Blue-sky sprites: These tiny, darting spots, visible against smooth blue backgrounds, are white cells moving in the blood vessels over the retina]]

5 mark 195: [[a long blob, slightly distorting the blue swath]]
Floaters: Some types of floaters are caused by breakdown of your eyeball goop as you age, but this type is some other kind of debris near the retina.  I don't know what.

10 mark 270: [[An askew crosshair and circle, with faint blue and yellow wedges inside]]
Humans can see polarization - Stare at a white area on an LCD display while rotating it or your head fast [[use straight ahead as the axis of rotation]].  Polarization direction is shown by a faint central yellow
blue shape.  (Also visible in deep blue skies)

from 0 to 30 mark 340: [[The same image, increasing in absolute size from a very tiny object in the center to one about 20x original size at 30 degrees. The brightness of the image varies from black at 2 mark 340, to gray at 5 mark 340, to nearly white at 10 mark 340, to slightly grayer at 20 mark 340, to medium gray at 30 mark 340.]]
Night Vision: Cone cells (sharp, central color vision) don't work in low light, but rod cells (monochrome, low-res, non-central) do.  This is why you can walk around in dim light, but not read.  It's also why you can spot fainter stars by looking next to them.

1126		Epsilon and Zeta		THE SAGA OF EPSILON AND ZETA
The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season saw devastating storms like Katrina and Rita. But less well-remembered is just how 
strange
 the season got toward the end.
The forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are the best of the best.
Their predictions are masterpieces of professional analysis. But in November 2005, out in the center of the Atlantic - far from any land - the atmosphere stopped making sense.
And the forecasters - who'd expected the season to be long over by now - started to get a little unhinged.
This is their story, as seen through the actual 2005 NHC Advisories:

[[Two men, one bald and one not, sit looking at their respective computers, at separate desks, back to back. The advisory is printed above them in caps
small-caps Courier type.]]
Tuesday, November 29th, 2005: 
Tropical Storm Epsilon . . .
The 26th named storm of the apparently never ending 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.

[[The same scene, different text.]]
10 PM Wed: The window of opportunity for strengthening should close in 12-24 hr.
4 PM Thu: Slow but steady weakening is expected to begin in 12-24 hours.

[[The man with hair now has questions marks above his head.]]
4 AM Fri: Epsilon does not appear weaker.
10 AM Fri: Epsilon has been upgraded to a 65-kt hurricane.

[[The two still sit back-to-back.]]
4 PM Sat: Epsilon has continued to strengthen against all odds . . . [but] can not maintain the current intensity much longer since the environment is becoming increasingly unfavorable.

[[Ditto.]]
10 PM Sat: Epsilon might or might not still be a hurricane . . . but in any case it likely will not be one on Sunday.
4 AM Sun: Epsilon is downgraded to a tropical storm. 

[[Yep.]]
10 AM Sun: Morning satellite images indicate that Epsilon has restrengthened.

[[A closer view of just the balding man at his desk.]]
There are no clear reasons . . . and I am not going to make one up . . . to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon and I am just describing the facts.
However . . . I still have to make an intensity forecast and the best bet at this time is to predict weakening . . . Epsilon will likely become a remnant low.
I heard that before about epsilon . . . haven't you?

[[The two men still sit back to back, but the man with hair is now turning his head toward the other man, with his arm resting on the back of his chair. The bald man is leaning forward in his seat, toward his computer while typing.]]
4 PM Mon: The cloud pattern continues to be remarkably well-organized for a hurricane at such high latitude
in December.

[[The other man has turned back to his own screen.]]
10 PM Mon: We have said this before . . . but Epsilon really does not appear as strong this evening as it did this afternoon.

[[Just the bald guy now.]]
4 AM Tue: 
I have run out of things to say.

[[The two of them again.]]
10 PM Tue: The end is in sight. It really really is. But in the meantime . . . Epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status. 
4 AM Wed: The end is in sight . . . yes . . . but not quiet yet. I thought I was going to find a weakening system and instead I found that Epsilon is still a hurricane.

[[Ditto.]]
10 AM  Thu: Convection has vanished and Epsilon is now a tight swirl of low clouds.
I hope this is the end of the long lasting 2005 hurricane season.

[[This panel is blank and just reads: Nope.]]

Enter Tropical Storm Zeta.
[[The men are still at their desks. The bald man is leaning back on his chair and staring at his screen, the other man's hair is noticeably disheveled, and he has started growing a five o'clock shadow.]]
Friday, December 30th, 2005: An elongated area of low pressure . . . which ahd its origins in an old frontal trough . . . began developing organized convection overnight. Advisories are initiated on the 27th tropical storm of 2005.

Any new storms would be in the 2006 season.
[[The men are still at their desks, the man with hair is even more bedraggled-looking.]]
4PM Fri: Although the atmosphere seems to want to develop tropical storms ad nauseam . . . the calendar will shortly put an end to the use of the Greek alphabet to name them.

But 2005's wouldn't end until Zeta did.
[[The bald man is now wearing a party hat and there is confetti in the air.]]
10 PM Sat: Zeta appeared on the verge of losing all of its deep convection a few hours ago . . . but since about 21z the convection has been on somewhat of an increase again.

[[A close view of the man with hair at his desk.]]
10 PM Sun: This is like Epsilon all over again. Most of the conventional guidance suggested that zeta should have been dissipated by now . . . well . . . zeta is pretty much alive at this time. 
I have no choice but to forecast weakening
again and again.

[[Both of them at their desks.]]
4 AM Mon: By 24-36 hours . . . a significant increase in westerly winds . . . should act to shear away most of the associated convection . . . and finally bring the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season to a merciful ending.
4 PM Mon: It is hard to conceive that a tropical cyclone will be able to survive for very long in such a hostile environment. therefore I have not backed off on the forecast of weakening.

[[And again.]]
10 PM Mon: Zeta is stronger than yesterday.
10 AM Wed: As you can see. . . I ran out of things to say.

[[And again.]]
4 AM Thu: Satellite intensity estimates have decreased. Zeta is downgraded to a 30 kt tropical depression.

[[And again.]]
10 AM Thu: Shortly after the previous advisory had been issued . . . regretfully . . . the intensity . . . increased to 35 kt and Zeta is a tropical storm once again.

[[And again.]]
10 PM Thu: Although it seems as if Zeta will never die . . . the forecast continues to show weakening.

[[Both men are now leaning back in their chairs, exhausted.]]
4 PM, Friday, January 6, 2006: Zeta no longer meets the criteria of a tropical cyclone. . . which means that both it and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season have ended. 
This is the national hurricane center signing off for 2005.

[[The bald man still sits at his desk, the man with hair is no longer in his chair.]]

[[Again, we see the bald man at his desk and the other guy's empty desk.]]
Bald guy: Actually, Zeta's cloud pattern is
Hair guy: (out of panel) NO.
Bald guy: Ok.

1227		The Pace of Modern Life		((This strip is in the form of a long series of quotes. Here, each quote is given as a separate panel. Attribution is delimited with a --. Some text is bolded; it is enclosed in asterisks.))
*The art of letter-writing is fast dying out.* When a letter cost nine pence, it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence... Now, however, we think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. *We fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper.*
-- The Sunday Magazine
1871

It is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to be always in a hurry. *In olden times it was different.*
-- The Medical Record
1884

With the advent of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion... the dreamy quiet old days are over... for *men now live think and work at express speed.* They have their 
Mercury
 or 
Post
 laid on their breakfast table in the early morning, and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal, they carry it off, to be *sulkily read as they travel... leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them*... the hurry and bustle of modern life... lacks the quiet and repose of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease...
-- William Smith, Morley: Ancient and Modern
1886

Conversation is said to be a lost art... good talk presupposes leisure, both for preparation and enjoyment. *The age of leisure is dead, and the art of conversation is dying.*
-- Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, volume 29
1890

Intellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced *a craving for literary nips*. The torpid brain... has grown too weak for sustained thought. 
*There never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly*. 
-- Israel Zangwill, The Bachelors' Club
1891

*The art of pure line engraving is dying out. We live at too fast a rate* to allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. If a picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance. The days when engravers were wont to spend two or three years over a single plate are for ever gone. 
-- Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, volume 1
1892

So much is exhibited to the eye that *nothing is left to the imagination*. It seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches, *and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that ahve been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary*.
The articles in the quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but *thirty pages is now too much*. So we witness a further condensing process and, we have the 
fortnightly
 and the 
contemporary
 which reduce thirty pages to *fifteen pages* so that you may read a larger number of articles in a shorter time and in a shorter form. As if this last condensing process were not enough the condensed articles of these periodicals are *further condensed* by the daily papers, which will give you *a summary of the summary* of that which has been written about everything. 
*Those who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works*. 
Ephemeral literature is driving out the great classics of the present and the past... *hurried reading can never be good reading*. 
-- G. J. Goschen, First annual address to the students, Toynbee Hall, London
1894

The existence of *mental and nervous degeneration among a growing class of people*, especially in large cities, is an obvious phenomenon... the mania for stimulants... diseases of the mind are almost as numerous as the diseases of the body... this intellectual condition is characterized by *a brain incapable of normal working... in a large measure due to the hurry and excitement of modern life*. with its facilities for rapid locomotion and almost instantaneous communication between remote points of the globe*...
-- The Churchman, volume 71
1895

If we *teach the children how to play* and encourage them in their sports... *instead of shutting them in badly ventilated schoolrooms*, the next generation will be more joyous and will be heailthier than the present one. 
-- Public Opinion: A Comprehensive Summary of the Press Throughout the World, volume 18
1895

The cuase of the... increase in nervous disease is *increased demand made by the coditions of modern life upon the brain*. Everything is done in a hurry. *We talk across a continent, telegraph across an ocean*, take a trip to Chicago for an hour's talk... *We even take our pleasures sadly and make a task of our play*... What wonder if the pressure is almost more than our nerves can bear. 
-- G. Shrady (from P. C. Knapp) "Are nervous diseases increasing?" Medical Record
1896

*The managers of sensational newspapers*... do not try to educate their readers and make them better, but tend to *create perverted tastes and develop vicious tendencies*. The owners of these papers seem to have but one purpose, and that is to increase their circulation.
-- Medical Brief, volume 26
1898

*To take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible* on account of the demands on our time made by our business... we act on the apparent belief that all of our business is so pressing that we must jump on the quickest car home, eat our dinner in the most hurried way, make the closest connection for car returning... 
-- Louis John Rettger, Studies in Advanced Physiology
1898

In these days of increasing rapid artificial locomotion, *may I be permitted to say a word in favour of a very worthy and valuable old friend of mine, Mr Long Walk?*
*I am afraid that this good gentleman is in danger of getting neglected, if not forgotten*. We live in days of water trips and land trips, excursions by sea, road and rail- bicycles and tricycles, tram cars and motor cars... but in my humble opinion, good honest walking exercise for health beats all other kinds of locomotion into a cocked hat. 
-- T. Thatcher, "A plea for a long walk", The Publishers' Circular
1902

The art of conversation is almost a lost one. *People talk as they ride bicycles - at a rush - without pausing to consider their surroundings*... What has been generally understood as cultured society is rapidly deteriorating into baseness and voluntary ignorance. *The profession of letters is so little understood*, and so far from being seriously appreciated, that... newspapers are full, not of thoughtful honestly expressed public opinion on the affairs of the nation, but of vapid personalities interesting to none save gossips and busy bodies. 
-- Marie Corelli, Free Opinions, Freely Expressed
1905

There is a great *tendency among the children of today to rebel against restraint*, not only that placed upon them by the will of the parent, but against any restraint or limitation of what they consider their rights... this fact has filled well minded people with great apprehensions for the future. 
-- Rev. Henry Hussmann, The Authority of Parents
1906

*Our modern family gathering, silent* around the fire, *each individual with his head buried in his favourite magazine*, is the somewhat natural outcome of the banishment of colloquy from the school...
-- The Journal of Education, volume 29
1907

Plays in theatres at the present time present spectacles and *deal openly with situations which no person would have dared to mention in general society forty years ago*... The current representations of *nude men and women in the daily journals* and the illustrated magazines would have excluded such periodicals from all respectable families two decades ago... Those who have been divorced... forty and fifty years ago lost at once and irrevocably their standing in society, while to-day they continue in all their social relationships, hardly changed...
-- Editorial, The Watchman, Boston
1908

We write millions more letters than did our grandfathers, but the increase in volume has brought with it an automatic artificial machine-like ring... an examination of a file of old letters reveals not only a remarkable grasp of details, but a *fitness and courtliness too often totally lacking* in the mechanical curt cut and dried letters of to-day. 
-- Forrest Crissey, Handbook of Modern Business Correspondence
1908

*A hundred years ago it took so long and cost so much to send a latter that it seemed worth while to put some time and thought into writing it*. Now the quickness and the cheapness of the post seem to justify the feeling that *a brief letter to-day may be followed by another next week - a "line" now by another to-morrow*. 
-- Percy Holmes Boynton, Principles of Composition 
1915

{{Title text: 'Unfortunately, the notion of marriage which prevails ... at the present time ... regards the institution as simply a convenient arrangement or formal contract ... This disregard of the sanctity of marriage and contempt for its restrictions is one of the most alarming tendencies of the present age.' --John Harvey Kellogg, Ladies' guide in health and disease (1883)}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_pace_of_modern_life.png

Einstein: If I were traveling at the speed of light, my butt would look *awesome*.
Einstein was famed for his Gedankedank.

{{Title text: Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. There is no road out of this oblivion; we must embrace it. We must join with the darkness. Ba'al the Annihilator offers us no happiness, no answers, naught but the cold embrace of the void. To imagine any other end is delusion. We must give in to the will of Ba'al, for he will one day consume us and our world alike. I therefore call on Congress to fully fund space exploration, and to join with Ba'al, the Eater of Souls. Thank you.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pale_blue_dot.png

1250		Old Accounts		[[A figure sits at a desk, using a laptop.]]
The Internet is filled with derelict accounts aggregating news about friends long forgotten. 
<<Click>>
Laptop: Uhh, is everything OK?
<<Click>>
Laptop: Dude, what the Hell?
<<Click>>
When you find yourself drifting away from a community, remember to clean up after yourself by slowly unfriending everyone, one by one, in the reverse order that you added them.

{{Title text: If you close an account while it's still friends with people, it contributes to database linkage accumulation slowdown, which is a major looming problem for web infrastructure and definitely not a thing I just made up.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/old_accounts.png
1251		Anti-Glass		[[Two police officers stand at an apartment door. The female officer is holding a pair of glasses with something attached to it. We will see later that Black Hat Guy is in the apartment]]
Female officer: Police. Open up. Did you make this glasses attachment?
Black hat guy {{through door}}: Oh, yeah. 

[[Black hat guy is sitting at his laptop.]]
Police officer: What's it do? 
Black hat guy: It detects when someone near you is wearing Google Glass and shines a laser pointer at their eyepiece.
Police officer: Why??
Black hat guy: The best defense is an indiscriminate offense. 

[[Cut back to officers outside the apartment.]]
Male officer: It seems you've mailed these devices to people across Silicon Valley, including the children of every Google executive. 
Black hat guy: Yeah. It's a viral marketing campaign for an upcoming movie. 

Male officer: What movie?
Black hat guy: haven't decided yet. Anything good coming out this fall?
Male officer: Sir, open the door. 
Black hat guy: First stare at the peephole for a sec.

1252		Increased Risk		[[Three figures are standing around. Two have beach towels. A woman is looking at her cell phone. One of them is beret guy.]]
Woman: We should go to the north beach. Someone said the south beach has a 20% higher risk of shark attacks. 
Man: Yeah, but statistically, taking three beach trips instead of two increases our odds of getting shot by a swimming dog carrying a handgun in its mouth by 50%! 
Beret guy: Oh no! This is our third trip! 
Reminder: A 50% increase in a tiny risk is still tiny. 

{{Title text: You may point out that strictly speaking, you can use that statement to prove that all risks are tiny--to which I reply HOLY SHIT WATCH OUT FOR THAT DOG!}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/increased_risk.png
1253		Exoplanet Names		August 2013: The Internation Astronomical Union decides to start naming exoplanets, and - for the first time ever - asks for suggestions from the general public.

1254		Preferred Chat System		[[A figure stands, talking on his cell phone.]]
Figure: Sorry for the voicemail, but I'm confused about how to reach you. 

Figure: When I text you, you reply once on GChat, then go quiet, yet answer IRC right away. I emailed you, and you replied on Skype and mentioned that the email "woke you up." 

Figure: You're very responsive - I just have no sense of how you use technology. 

[[An owl flies into the panel.]]
Figure: ?!?

[[The owl perches on the figure's head. It has delivered a note to the figure.]]

Figure in hat: Everyone said the world was flat, but Columbus knew it was round. 
Woman: <<Sigh>> No, no, no. 

[[The woman walks into frame. The children turn to look.]]
Woman: So he took his ships and sailed west in a line tangent to the surface. The sea fell away, and he landed in *Valinor*. 

Woman: A Silmaril on his brow, he wanders the heavens as the morning star, still believing he reached India. 
Figure in hat: Stop making stuff up. 
Woman: You first.

Figure 1: It's as long as a football field. Runs as fast as a cheetah.
Figure 2: Weighs as much as a blue whale. 
Figure 3: Can we negotiate with it? 
Figure 4: No. It has the intelligence of a two-year-old child. 
By the time the Frequently-Made Comparisons Monster was finally defeated, it had eaten enough people to fill a stadium and devastated an area the size of Rhode Island.

1259		Bee Orchid		[[Beret guy and a woman are walking through a wood.]]
Woman: There are these orchids whose flowers look like female bees. When males try to mate with them, they transfer pollen. 

[[The woman kneels next to a flower.]]
Woman: This orchid - Ophrys Apifera - makes flowers, but no bees land on them because the bee it mimics went extinct long ago. 

[[The woman stands.]]
Woman: Without its partner, the orchid has resorted to self-pollinating, a last-ditch genetic strategy that only delays the inevitable. Nothing of the bee remains, but we know it existed from the shape of this flower. 

[[They walk on past the flower.]]
Woman: It's an idea of what the female bee looked like to the male bee... ... as interpreted by a plant.
Beret guy: Wow, so...

[[We see a full-colour painting of an orchid flower. It has purple-pink petals on a mottled grey background, along with the bee-like parts. It's quite a realistic painting.]]

{{Title text: Some future reader, who may see the term, without knowing the history of it, may imagine that it had reference to some antiquated bridge of the immortal Poet, thrown across the silver Avon, to facilitate his escape after some marauding excursion in a neighbouring park; and in some Gentleman's Magazine of the next century, it is not impossible, but that future antiquaries may occupy page after page in discussing so interesting a matter. We think it right, therefore, to put it on record in the Oriental Herald that the 'Shakesperian Rope Bridges' are of much less classic origin; that Mr Colin Shakespear, who, besides his dignity as Postmaster, now signs himself 'Superintendent General of Shakesperian Rope Bridges', is a person of much less genius than the Bard of Avon. --The Oriental Herald, 1825}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/2014.png
1312		Haskell		[[Two people are conversing.]]
Person #1: Code written in Haskell is guaranteed to have no side effects.
Person #2: ...because no one will ever run it?
 
{{Title text: The problem with Haskell is that it's a language built on lazy evaluation and nobody's actually called for it.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/haskell.png
1313		Regex Golf		[[A woman sits at a laptop, leaning back over her chair to address a figure.]]
Regex golf: 
Woman: You try to matchone one group but not the other. 
M | [TN]|B
 matches Star Wars subtitles but not Star Trek. 
Figure: Cool. 

[[We zoom to just show the woman, looking at her screen.]]
Meta-regex golf: 
Woman: So I wrote a program that plays regex golf with arbitrary lists...
Figure: Uh oh...

[[We zoom back out. The figure is facepalming. The woman is typing.]]
Meta-meta-regex golf: 
Woman: ...but I lost my code, so I'm grepping for files that look like regex golf solvers. 

[[We zoom back in.]]
... And beyond:
Woman: Really, this is all 
(meta-)*regex golf
.
Figure: Now you have infinite problems. 
Woman: No, I had those already. 

{{Title text:

1314		Photos		[[A man in a hat stands next to another figure on a roof. There's a sunset; in the distance, there are three people taking photos of the skyline as the sun sets.]]
Hat guy: Ugh, I hate how people take pictures instead of just enjoying the view. 
Figure: Why? 

[[Hat guy turns to the figure.]]
Hat guy: Documenting your live distracts you from living it. You're not really-
Figure: Oh, come on. 

[[We zoom on their faces.]]
Figure: Trying to take a picture of a thing makes me pay more attention to it. Some of my best adventures are built around trying to photograph something.

[[We just see the figure's face.]]
Figure: If "other people having experiences incorrectly" is annoying to you, think how unbearable it must be to have a condescending stranger tell you they hate the way you're experiencing your life at just the moment you've found something you want to remember. Why the fuck do you care how someone else enjoys a sunset? 

[[We zoom back out.]]
Hat guy: Well, they... Because I just, uh... ...

[[The figure takes out a camera.]]
Figure's camera: <<Click>>

{{Title text: I hate when people take photos of their meal instead of eating it, because there's nothing I love more than the sound of other people chewing.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/photos.png
1315		Questions for God		[[A woman and a man are out for a walk.]]
Woman: Horace Lamb said he would have two questions for God: Why quantum mechanics, and why turbulence?

{{Title text: What sins could possibly darken the heart of a STEAMBOAT? I asked The Shadow, but he says he only covers men.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/questions_for_god.png
1316		Inexplicable		[[A figure sits at a desk with a laptop. A woman is off-screen.]]
Figure: Argh! 
Woman: What? 
Figure: Why do I always have these inexplicable, impossible-to-diagnose computer problems? 

[[The woman walks up to the desk.]]
Figure: After six hours of this, I've concluded nothing works or makes sense. I give up on logic. 
Woman: <<sigh>>Gimme. I'll figure it out. 
Figure: You won't. 

[[The figure sits at his laptopless desk. Off-screen, we can hear the woman working on it. 
<<Type type>>
<<Click>>
Woman: ?

Woman: ???

[[The woman is back in front of the desk, clutching the laptop.]]
Figure: How'd it go? 
Woman: Your computer is literally haunted. 
Figure: Told you. 

{{Title text: 'It has a ghost in it. Take it back.' 'No.'}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/inexplicable.png
1317		Theft		[[A figure sits in front of a laptop, apparently talking to it.]]
Figure: I feel paralyzed by overwhelming existential dread. ...And yet for some reason I'm really excited about space? 
The thief who stole my identity has a lot to deal with. 

{{Title text: Is he ALSO wondering at what point our thoughts diverged, if they even have yet? 'dude, I think he just took your credit card' AM I THE ORIGINAL? HOW DO I TELL?}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/theft.png
1318		Actually		((The text of the comic is circular. Each statement is followed by the next, wrapping around back to the original speaker. Thus, the speaker chosen to be "first" below is chosen arbitrarily - in this case, the one that is facing upwards on the page.))
[[6 figures stand on the surface of a circle, equidistant around it.]]
First figure: Actually, measurements suggest it's flat.
Second figure: Actually, it's a sphere.
Third figure: Actually, it's an oblate spheroid.
Fourth figure: Actually, it's a shape defined by the EGM96 coefficients.
Fifth figure: Actually, it's that plus local topography.
Sixth figure: Actually, it's embedded in a universe that's curved.
((And thus the text has arrived back at the beginning of the first figure's statement.))

{{Title text: Protip: You can win every exchange just by being one level more precise than whoever talked last. Eventually, you'll defeat all conversational opponents and stand alone.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/actually.png
1319		Automation		"I spend a lot of time on this task. I should write a program automating it!"

[[Panel titled "Theory:" at the top contains a line plot, with "work" on the y-axis and "time" on the x-axis. Two curves indicate "work on the original task" eventually being permanently reduced by temporarily spending more work on coding, and then having the produced automation take over.]]

[[Panel titled "Reality:" at the top contains a similar line plot, but the line for "work on the original task" does not decrease. The second curve, which starts out as "writing code", becomes "debugging", "rethinking", and then "ongoing development". The line for work on the original task becomes dotted, with the label "no time for original task anymore."]]

{{Title text: 'Automating' comes from the roots 'auto-' meaning 'self-', and 'mating', meaning 'screwing'.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png

...it inevitably becomes the Walmart of social interaction.

{{Title text: What I really want is to hang out where I hung out with my friends in college, but have all my older relatives there too.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/walmart.png
1321		Cold		[[Two figures in winter hats, one hat white and the other hat black, are walking.]]
White Hat: It is brutal out. So much for global warming, huh?
<<Black Hat sighs>>
Black Hat: This used to happen all the time.
White Hat: What?

[[A picture of an x-y plot, with years from 1970 to 2014 along the x-axis and dots rising up for each year, mostly concentrated from 1970 to 1999. The plot is labeled "Days with lows < 0°F".]]
Black Hat: You're from St. Louis, right? On average, it used to get below 0°F there a handful of days per year. But you haven't had a day like that since the nineties.

[[The two figures continue walking.]]
Black Hat: Then, in 2014, when the first polar vortex hit, it dipped below zero for two days. And everyone freaked out because what used to be normal now feels too cold.
White Hat: It is too cold!

[[Panel labeled "The future:" contains a generic figure, looking at a frozen puddle on the ground.]]
Figure: Look at this - ice! In St. Louis! So much for global warming.
<<off-panel sigh>>

{{Title text: 'You see the same pattern all over. Take Detroit--' 'Hold on. Why do you know all these statistics offhand?' 'Oh, um, no idea. I definitely spend my evenings hanging out with friends, and not curating a REALLY NEAT database of temperature statistics. Because, pshh, who would want to do that, right? Also, snowfall records.'}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cold.png
1322		Winter		[[Two figures, one in a winter hat and the other in a beret, are walking through snow and across a patch of ice.]]
Beret Figure: The sky is cold and the floor water is too hard to drink.

[[The figure with the beret looks upwards.]]
Beret Figure: But I have my handcoats and the spacelight is warm.

[[The two figures continue on through woods; there are musical notes coming from the trees.]]
Beret Figure: Listen - the flappy planes are beeping in the stick towers.

[[The figure with the winter hat pauses.]]
Hat Figure: Those are all the wrong words for those things.
((Beret Figure replies from off panel.))
Beret Figure: Maybe - but the things themselves are all right. So who cares?

[[The figure with the winter hat continues walking, with sunlight and musical notes above.]]

{{Title text: Stay warm, little flappers, and find lots of plant eggs!}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/winter.png
1323		Protocol		[[A standing figure is conversing with another figure who is sitting on computer desk chair. Behind the sitting figure is a desk with a flat-panel monitor.]]
Standing figure: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere.
Sitting figure: Uh huh.
Standing figure: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place.
Sitting figure: With you so far.
Standing figure: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet.
Sitting figure: Yeah?

I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story.

{{Title text: Changing the names would be easier, but if you're not comfortable lying, try only making friends with people named Alice, Bob, Carol, etc.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/protocol.png
1324		Weather		[[Shorthair and Cueball are talking.]]
Shorthair: So, how 'bout this weather?
Cueball: I know, right? The whole jet stream layer is nuts!
Shorthair: Um, sure...
Cueball: The 18z GFS forecasts 960MB by Tuesday, Think it'll verify?
Shorthair: What?

Person #1: Women 
say

Woman: Ever hear of the Kola borehole? 
Black hat guy: No - what's that? 
Woman: A Soviet project to drill deap into the earth's crust. 

[[The woman turns around; we see her head and shoulders.]]
Woman: There's a hoax report claiming that their drill broke through into a superhot cavern, and when they lowered a microphone into the hole, they heard tormented screaming. People say that's why the miners sealed the well and abandoned the project.

[[The woman turns back to her laptop.]]
Black hat guy: Why would anyone believe that story? 
Woman: I guess some people think Hell is literally an underground place. 

[[Black hat guy turns around and addresses the woman.]]
Black hat guy: No - I mean, why would the miners seal the opening? Why not just dig a canal connecting it to the ocean? Unless they like Hell.

[[The woman turns back around.]]
Woman: ... If there's ever a war between earth and Hell, I hope I'm on your side. 
Black hat guy: You seem nice; you probably won't be.

I should probably patch OpenSSL.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heartbleed.png
1354		Heartbleed Explanation		How the Heartbleed Bug Works:

[[Meg stands by a server. There's a thought bubble arising from the server showing the data the server is currently processing, including a portion that states "User Meg wants these six letters: POTATO."]]
Meg: Server, are you still there? If so, reply "POTATO" (6 letters).

[[The 6 letters "POTATO" are highlighted yellow in the server's thought bubble, and the server emits "POTATO".]]

[[The phrase "User Meg wants these 4 letters: BIRD." is in the server's thought bubble with other data around it, with "BIRD" highlighted. The server is emitting "BIRD".]]
Meg: Hmm...

[[The phrase "User meg wants these 500 letters: HAT." is in the server's thought bubble, along with other data around it.]]
Meg: Server, are you still there? IF so, reply "HAT" (500 letters).

[["HAT" and many more characters after it in the thought bubble are highlighted, and the server emits a long string of text starting with "HAT" but then including much more other unrelated data. Meg is busily writing it down in a notebook.]]

It dips shallowly for a while, then starts to increase slightly for a time, labeled 'actual job at NASA'. The line starts to slope downward again, and then shoots up very, very high. The beginning of this increase is labeled 'started playing Kerbal Space Program'.]]

{{Title text: To be fair, my job at NASA was working on robots and didn't actually involve any orbital mechanics.

[[A door that is ajar.]]
Person: And they're showing you the door.

In 1969, Nixon staffer William Safire wrote a speech for the president to deliver if the Apollo 11 return launch failed, stranding the doomed astronauts on the moon.

Uncovered in 1999, it is often call the greatest speech never given.

Today, the full set of Safire's contingency speeches has been found.

((First speech))
In Event Astronauts Stranded On Moon
Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace.

In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.

Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts. For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Second speech))
In Event Spacecraft Goes Missing
Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins went to the moon as ambassadors of peace for all mankind, and all mankind prays that they may yet return safely home.

We are separated from the moon by a vast gulf of space, against which their tiny vessel appeared as but a drifting speck. For a few brief seconds, we took our eye off them, and despite days of desperate searching, never again was their vessel sighted from Earth.

While these men are lost they are not forgotten and their sacrifice will not-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Third speech))
In Event Astronauts Abscond With Spacecraft
We do not know what led Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins to betray the trust we placed in them, abandon their mission, and steer their vessel toward Mars. Nor do we know what compelled them to transmit such hurtful messages back to earth, heaping contempt on their onetime home.

But whatever the cause of their dereliction, I call upon the United States to commit itself, before this year is out, to launching a mission to chase down Apollo 11 and return its crew to face Justice. We must not rest until-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Fourth speech))
In Event Spacecraft Returns With Extra Astronauts
While this is much we do not understand, tonight all of Earth is united in celebrating the safe return of our brave explorers.

We of course have many questions, and in the day and weeks to come we will demand answers. How many souls were truly aboard Apollo 11 when it launched? Who are the six men now in quarantine aboard the USS Hornet? What happened-- <<notes are truncated>>

((Fifth speech))
In Event Spacecraft Hits U.S.S. Hornet, Crushing Nixon

President Agnew: Tonight, we have experienced a great national triumph and a great national loss. We take joy in the safe return from the moon of Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins, but that joy is tempered with sorrow as we mourn our president's tragic death beneath their wayward capsule.

Richard Nixon wholeheartedly supported our courageous astronauts as they carried the hopes and prayers of Earth to the heavens, and in the moment of their homecoming, he himself has departed on that ultimate voyage. As we grieve, we must rededicate ourselves to the cause for which our president-- <<notes are truncated>>

1530		Keyboard Mash		[[A person walks toward their computer desk as the screen indicates "new chat message."]]

[[The screen shows a text conversation (where lines are contained in speech bubble boxes) between White Hat Guy and the first person.]]

WHG: Can't sleep. Stupid dogs keep barking.
          FJAFJKLDWSKF7JKFDJ

FP: Ugh, I'm sorry. Maybe you could...
      ...OK, wait. I have to ask. 
      How did you hit a "7" in the middle there?

WHG: Huh?
          I was just randomly keyboard mashing.

FP: Sorry, right.

WHG: Anyway,

FP: ...I know this is silly, but like... all your hands were clearly on the home row.
     I don't get how one finger could have stretched up to the "7."

WHG: Why do you always fixate on these bizarre details?

FG: I don't know.
      Sorry.

WHG: It's weird, is all.
         
[[A giant spider dangles from the ceiling, typing at a laptop on a desk, while White Hat Guy is suspended upside down, wrapped in spider thread. The chair lies on the floor on its side. The conversation continues on the computer.]]
Spider:I am a normal human typing with my human hands.

1531		The BDLPSWDKS Effect		[[A person with a ponytail stands in front of a projector screen with an image of a speeding firetruck hurtling toward a person on it. They hold a pointer, and indicate towards the image.]]
Ponytail: The Bernoulli-Dopper-Leidenfrost-Peltzman-Sapir-Whorf-Dunning-Kruger-Stroop Effect states that if a speeding fire truck lifts off and hurtles toward you on a layer of superheated gas, you'll dive out of the way faster if the driver screams "RED!" in a 
non
-tonal language that 
has
 a word for "firefighter" than if they scream "GREEN!" in a 
tonal
 language with 
no
 word for "firefighter" which you 
think
 you're fluent in but 
aren't.

{{Title text: This well-known effect has of course been replicated in countless experiments.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_bdlpswdks_effect.png

1: What do you drink? Stouts? Lagers?
2: Uh, anything's fine.

[[Person 1 is drinking from a bottle while Person 2 holds his in his hand.]]
2: ...do you ever think maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?

[[Person 2 drinks from his bottle and Person 1 holds his.]]
1: Man, you are no fun at all.
2: Ok, got it. Not a word.
1: Dude, if you don't like it, don't drink it.

First year: Primarily the pet's name, and sometimes words related to the pet.

Second year: Primarily words related to the pet, and sometimes the pets name or coherent words of any kind.

Third year: Words related to the pet, or coherent words of any kind, and sometimes not even that.

Fourth year onward: Terms which do not belong in any of the aforementioned categories.

{{Title text: Seventh year: Perfectly coherent words, but in the pet's language, not mine.}}		https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/words_for_pets.png
1536		The Martian		[[White Hat Guy comes up behind Stickman while he is sitting at a desk looking at a laptop.]]
SM: Ooh, trailer for 
The Martian
! 
WHG: What's that?
SM: Movie of a book I liked.
WHG: Should I read it?

[[Stickman turns around in his chair to face White Hat Guy.]]
SM: Depends. You know the scene in Apollo 13 where the guy says "we have to figure out how to connect 
this
 thing to 
this
 thing using 
this
 table full of parts or the astronauts will all die?"
WHG: Yeah?

[[Stickman turns back to the laptop.]]
SM: 
The Martian
 is for people who wish the whole movie had just been more of that scene.
WHG: How on earth did 
that
 become a big-budget thing with Matt Damon?
SM: No idea, but I'm 
so
 excited.

1539		Planning		[[Two people walk along, one with light hair and a ponytail, another with shortish dark hair.]]
Ponytail: Why are people so comfortable handing Google and Facebook all this control over our lives?
Dark hair: I dunno. - Our species built thousands of nuclear weapons, scattered them around the planet, and then moved on to other things. - Maybe it's best to accept that some of this big-picture planning is just happening on autopilot.

1567		Kitchen Tips		[[A enthused CHEF speaks to us from behind a counter loaded with spices & kitchen things.]]
Chef: If you're anything like me, you may have trouble telling when meat is fully cooked.
Chef: Instead of guessing, try a meat thermometer.

[[Chef stands between a full trash can on one side, and sink on the other. Chef holds a dirty plate, like the exact opposite of a glistening beacon of cleanliness.]]
Chef: If you're anything like me, you probably throw away your plates and glasses when they get dirty. But if you clean them, they can often be used again!

[[Chef is busy with a frying pan over a stove.]]
Chef: Making scrambled eggs? Put a pan under them!
Chef: It's easier, and it keeps your burners cleaner.

[[Chef sprays a garden hose into the freezer side of a combination refrigerator
freezer. Water is flowing out.]]
Chef: If you're anything like me, you make ice by spraying a hose into your freezer and then slamming it shut.
Chef: But there's a better way....

[[Now in silhouette we see the pillar is several hundred feet tall, covered in antennae, and the figures are as ants in its shadow.]]
haircut: that's a cell tower.
beret: no way-- it has branches! See? I'm gonna climb it!

[[Beret guy begins to shimmy up the side of the pole. Somehow. With impressively powerful thighs I guess.]]
haircut: No, they just put those there to make it look-- ...never mind.

[[Later...]]
haircut: Why do I have no signal?
beret, with an axe: there were scary giants with yellow helmets in that tree! luckily, I cut it down before they ate me.

1576		I Could Care Less		[[Two Friends walking and talking.]]
Monologuer: ...anyway, I could care less.

Listener: I think you mean you COULDN'T care less. Saying you COULD care less implies you care at least some amount.

Monologuer: I dunno.

[[Monologuer begins to monologue over many panels]]
We're these unbelievably complicated brains drifting through a void, trying in vain to connect with one another by blindly flinging words out into the darkness.

Every choice of phrasing and spelling and tone and timing carries countless signals and contexts and subtexts and more,

and every listener interprets those signals in their own way.

Language isn't a formal system. Language is a glorious chaos.

You can never know for sure what ANY words will mean to ANYONE.

All you can do is try to get better at guessing how your words affect people, so you can have a chance of finding the ones that will make them feel something like what you want them to feel.

Everything else is pointless.

I assume you're giving me tips on how you interpret words because you want me to feel less alone.

If so, then thank you.

That means a lot.

But if you'r ejust running my sentences past some mental checklist so you can show off how well you know it,

then I could care less.

[[A person monologues to another]]

Lots of apps let you plan your tirps using real-time bus, train, and traffic data. They try to predict which route will be faster, but aren't always right.

Instead of just planning, my new app lets you send "ghost" versions of you along different routes, simulating their travel using the real-time data.

That way, you can see which route turned out to be faster in practice. You can also race your past selves.

[[Soon: Person dashing out of a taxi, twenty feet behind a ghost.]]
Ugh, lost to the bike ghost AGAIN.

WB: Hi! I have a microphone so I'm real loud now. - How does this Mars data compare to data from other fields? Like medicine? Or sports?

[[The spokesperson responds from out of panel, we still see White Beret with the microphone.]]
Spokesperson: That question makes no sense.
WB: If there's water on Mars, is it ruined? - Or will it be okay when it dries out?
Spokesperson: Any

Person 1:Now a study* claims that humans in pre-industrial societies stay up late, and sleep 6 or 7 horus a night, just like most people today.
White Hat Guy: Huh. So what you're saying is..
{{Footnote*: DOI: 10.1016
j.cub.2015.09.046}}

Person 1: Maybe we're overthinking it.
White Hat Guy: But what caused our modern epidemic of overthinking?! Plumbing? Or is it email?
Person 1: Modern? I bet the wheel was invented by someone overthinking "pushing".

Wait- he missed!

Oh good, they're letting him try again.

Beret Guy: The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy, but he's ignoring them. Wow.

Beret Guy: This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them. 
-
It's just him though. None of his teammates are joining in.

Beret Guy: That guy just ran to the second pillow when no one was looking! 
-
Everyone's real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there's nothing that says he can't do that.  
-
Yikes. Hopefully they can fix that once this game is over.

Controller 2: On the live feed- a cool bird just flew past the tower!

Controller 2: Like a hawk, maybe!
Controller 1: Could it be a vulture?
Controller 2: I doubt it. The wings were flat, not in a "V".
Controller 1: It could be an eagle!
Controller 2: Ooh!

Controller 1: This is launch control. We have a possible sighting of a cool bird. Halt the countdown.

Person 1: This is git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree model.
Person 2: Cool. How do we use it?
Person 1: No idea. Just memorize these shell commands and type them to sync up.
If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy.

[[A diagram showing the most obvious progression of events.  First just one bottle is sent from the warehouse to a person.  Then two.  Then five.  Then 20.
Finally, a direct pipe sends the water along.]]

I vote we start calling municipal plumbing "on-demand hyperloop-style water delivery" and see if we can sell anyone on the idea.

[[A stick figure on a hoverboard can navigate around a field with platforms and barriers, reminiscent of a pinball machine, from top to bottom and left to right.

X=1 "It's a start."
X=2-4 "Not bad."
X=5-9 "Terrific!"
X=10-16 (No message.)
X=17 "You found all the coins! Great job!"

However, if you leave the bounds of the playing field in either direction, a message in large red letters will flash:

5 Discuss: new picture
5.1 Current one looks awfully bleak
5.2 Gray sky
5.3 What about this one
5.4 Also bleak
5.5 Maybe this place just looks that way
5.6 Found a better picture, more colourful
5.7 That's a shot from Disney's Zootopia

7 Infobox picture: I just realised you can see a murder happening in the background
7.1 This city is terrible
7.2 Photoshopped out murder
7.3 Can someone just take a better picture
7.4 Okay, uploaded a new picture
7.5 Wait, never mind, I just noticed there's a murder in this one, too
8 1982 secession still in effect?
9 I think the murderer is reverting my edits
10 Why does this article take any position on correct condom use, let alone such a weird and ambiguous one?
11 Train station "designed by Andrew Lloyd Webber"?
11.1 They probably mean Frank Lloyd Wright

11.3 Didn't know he did architecture
11.4 Roof collapse
